<h1 title="">A TICKET TO ADVENTURE</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span>
<br />THE LITTLE MAN IN BLACK</h2>
<p>Mary Hughes had walked the entire
length of the long dock at Anchorage,
Alaska. Now, having rounded a great pile of
merchandise, tents, tractors, groceries, hammers,
axes, and boxes of chocolate bars she
came quite suddenly upon the oddest little
man she had ever seen. Even for a girl in her
late teens, Mary was short and slender. This
man was no larger than she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Japanese,&rdquo; she thought as her surprised
eyes took in his tight-fitting black suit, his
stiff collar and bright tie. &ldquo;But no, a Jap
wouldn&rsquo;t look like that.&rdquo; She was puzzled and
curious. At that particular moment, she had
nothing to do but indulge her curiosity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Together with hundreds of other &ldquo;home-seekers&rdquo;&mdash;she
smiled as she thought of herself
as a home-seeker&mdash;she had been dumped into
the bleak Arctic morning. Some of the goods
that were being hoisted by a long steel crane
from the depths of a ship, belonged to Mary,
to Mark her brother, and to Florence Huyler
her cousin. There was, for the time, nothing
they could do about that. So&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mister Il-ay-ok.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her surprise, she heard the little man
addressing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she breathed. She was thinking, &ldquo;Now
perhaps I am to know about this little man.&rdquo;
She was, but not too much&mdash;at least not for
some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! So you are Mr. Il-ay-ok,&rdquo; she encouraged.
&ldquo;Is this your home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no indeed!&rdquo; He spoke as if he were
reading from a book. &ldquo;My home is quite distant.
North,&rdquo; he pointed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Mary did not finish. At that instant a loud,
harsh-sounding voice broke in upon them.
&ldquo;Mister Il-ay-ok! MISTER! Har! Har! Har!
That&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; The man who had made his
appearance, as if by magic, from the great pile
of merchandise, where he had, the girl thought
with an inward shudder, been hiding, burst
into a roar of hoarse laughter. To say that
Mary was surprised and startled would not
express it at all.</p>
<p>She looked at him in silent alarm. He too
was strange. He was a white man with
a back so straight you might have run a
yard stick up it and made it touch at every
point. He had a horse-like nose, very long and
straight. There was something about his
whole bearing that made Mary want to slap
him. She would, too, had she felt that the occasion
warranted it. She was little, was Mary,
but her snapping black eyes could shoot
fire. Those slender brown legs of hers, hidden
for the moment by brown slacks, and her steel-spring-like
arms were made for action.</p>
<p>Mary could, at times, be quite still as well.
A cat is like that. Just now she stood quite
still and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are Mister Il-ay-ok, now, eh,
Tony?&rdquo; The stranger stopped laughing to
pucker his brow into a scowl that did not improve
his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t want to meet him in the dark!&rdquo;
the girl thought with another shudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Want to know what he is, Miss?&rdquo; the white
man turned to Mary. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an Eskimo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, an&mdash;&rdquo; Mary was surprised and pleased.
She was not allowed to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup, Miss, an Es-ki-mo.&rdquo; The man filled
his voice with suggestions of loathing and utmost
contempt. &ldquo;Just an oil-guzzling, blubber-eating,
greasy Eskimo that lives in a hole
in the ground. That&rsquo;s what he is to me. But
to you he&rsquo;s Mister Il-ay-ok. Bah!&rdquo; The man
turned and walked away.</p>
<p>For a full moment nothing further was said.
At last, in a steady, school-book voice the little
man in black said, &ldquo;Do you know what my
people did to the first white man who visit
our village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What?&rdquo; Mary stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shot him,&rdquo; the little man&rsquo;s voice dropped.
&ldquo;Shot him with a whale gun. Very big gun.
Shoot big shell. Like this!&rdquo; He held up a
clenched fist. &ldquo;Very bad man like this one.
He talked too big,&rdquo; the little man scowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you like to shoot that one?&rdquo;
Mary asked, nodding toward the retreating
figure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. Mebby byum bye. You see,&rdquo; the
little man smiled, &ldquo;I go to visit your country.
I am&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Florence Huyler, Mary&rsquo;s
big cousin came booming along from behind
the pile of goods, to cry: &ldquo;Ah! There you are!
I&rsquo;ve been looking everywhere for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; Mary stopped her, &ldquo;this is Mr.
Il-ay-ok. He&rsquo;s from Alaska, and he wants to
kill a white man, but not just now.&rdquo; She
laughed in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is Alaska.&rdquo; Florence, who was
big and strong as a man, looked at the little
man and smiled as she asked, &ldquo;Is this your
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; the little man bowed. &ldquo;Much
more north my home. Cape Nome sometimes
and sometimes Cape Prince Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;ve been in Nome?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s eyes
shone. &ldquo;My grandfather went there years and
years ago. He never came back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name please?&rdquo; the little man asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes,&rdquo; the little man beamed. &ldquo;I know
him. Big man. Very good man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the big girl&rsquo;s eyes fairly bulged.
&ldquo;You, you know my grandfather? No! No!
He is dead. He must have died years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dead please. Tom Kennedy not
dead,&rdquo; the little man appeared puzzled. &ldquo;No
not dead. Let me tell you.&rdquo; He took a step
toward them. &ldquo;Very big man. Very straight.
Always smile. Let me show you.&rdquo; To their
vast surprise the girls saw the little man produce
from an inside pocket a small, ivory
paper knife. On its blade had been carved the
likeness of a man&rsquo;s face. It may not have been
a very accurate picture, there was, however,
one touch that could not be wrong, a scar
above the left eye. &ldquo;Tom Kennedy my friend,&rdquo;
the native said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Kennedy, my long-lost grandfather!&rdquo;
Florence stared in unbelief. &ldquo;He is dead. And
yet, he&mdash;he must be alive!&rdquo; She closed her
eyes as she tried to think clearly. Often and
often as a small child she had heard her mother
describe this man, her grandfather. Often too
she had seen his picture. Always there had
been that scar over the left eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her voice rising
high. &ldquo;My grandfather is alive, somewhere
away up there!&rdquo; she faced north. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you couldn&rsquo;t leave us!&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s
tone vibrated with consternation. &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t leave us, not just now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that&rsquo;s right. I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;not just
now.&rdquo; The big girl&rsquo;s hands dropped limply to
her side.</p>
<p>From the distance came the long drawn
hoarse hoot of a steamboat whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse please,&rdquo; the little man who called
himself Mr. Il-ay-ok bowed low. &ldquo;My boat
please. I go to visit America. Perhaps please,
we meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the swift, sure movement of one who
has followed a dog team over long, long miles
or has hunted on the treacherous ice-floes, he
was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Florence repeated slowly as if to herself,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one full moment she stood staring at
the spot from which the little man had vanished.
Here indeed was a strange situation.
All her life she had believed her grandfather
dead. From her mother&rsquo;s lips she had heard
vague stories of how he had gone into the
north and never returned. Now here was a
little Eskimo saying, &ldquo;Tom Kennedy my
friend. Yes, I know him. He is alive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And he proved it too,&rdquo; the girl whispered
to herself.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, her thoughts came back
to the present and to her immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a jumble!&rdquo; she said, looking at the
heap of goods that, as moments passed, grew
higher and higher. &ldquo;How will they ever get
them sorted out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to her cousin, bright-eyed, eager
Mary, she said: &ldquo;&lsquo;A ticket to adventure,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
what the man back there in San Francisco
called it, &lsquo;a ticket to adventure.&rsquo; Will it truly
be an adventure? I wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so!&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s eyes shone.</p>
<p>Turning, the two girls walked away toward
a distant spot on the long dock where a boy,
who had barely grown into a young man, was
struggling at the task of setting up a small
umbrella tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; the big girl cried, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Mark. He&rsquo;s
setting up our first home in a wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />THE INDIAN GIRL&rsquo;S WARNING</h2>
<p>Hours later Florence stirred uneasily in her
sleep, then half-awake murmured dreamily:
&ldquo;A ticket to adventure. That&rsquo;s what he said,
a ticket&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conscious now that some disturbing sound
had come to her in her sleep, she shook herself
into further wakefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Everything is
so strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed it was. The bed on which she and
Mary slept was hard, a mattress on the dock.
About her, shielding her from the Arctic wind
was a tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;we start to the
Promised Land.&rdquo; This land was the Matamuska
Valley in Alaska. &ldquo;Not far now, only
a short way by rail. And then&mdash;&rdquo; A thrill ran
through her being. They were to be pioneers,
modern pioneers, she and Mary, Mark and
her aunt. What would life in this new land be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>She had seen much of life, had Florence,
city life, country life, the wild beauty of Isle
Royale in Lake Superior, and the finished
beauty of France were not new to her. But
Alaska! How she had thrilled at thought of
it! She was thinking of all this when, of a sudden,
she raised herself on one elbow to listen.
&ldquo;What was that sound?&rdquo; she whispered. It
was faint, indistinct, disturbing.</p>
<p>Then Mary sleeping at her side, did a
strange thing. Sitting bolt upright she said:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a space of seconds she appeared to listen
for an answer. Then, with a sigh, she murmured,
&ldquo;Oh! All right. Some other time.&rdquo; At
that, she sank back in her place to draw the
covers closely about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking in her sleep,&rdquo; the big girl thought.
&ldquo;Dreaming of the little man in black. She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was that sound again, more distinct
now. &ldquo;A child crying in the night.&rdquo; Florence
listened intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a low cry,&rdquo; she thought wearily,
creeping back among the blankets. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t
be anything very much. There has been so
much crying.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Ah yes, there had been children&rsquo;s cries that
day; rough, unkind words had been said at
times to the children. Little wonder, for they
had that day&mdash;hundreds of men, women and
children&mdash;disembarked from a ship that carried
them far toward their promised land, the
Matamuska Valley in Alaska.</p>
<p>They had been dumped quite unceremoniously,
a whole shipload of people with cows,
horses, dogs, cats, canaries, trucks, tractors,
tents, lumber, hardware, groceries, shoes, hammers,
saws, and clothespins on the dock at
Anchorage. Men dashed about searching for
tents and baggage. Women sought out lost or
strayed pets. Children had cried and above it
all had come the hoarse shout of some enthusiast:
&ldquo;On! On! to our new home! Three
cheers for Alaska!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over all this darkness had fallen. After a
cold supper, having pitched their tents and
spread their blankets, they had stretched out
on the rough surface of the dock to sleep, if
sleep they could. And now Florence was hearing
that distressing moan of a child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Near at hand,&rdquo; she thought, raising herself
on an elbow to listen once more, this time more
closely. &ldquo;A strange sort of cry. Can&rsquo;t be a
child from our party. I&rsquo;ve heard them all cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed she had. The long journey half way
across America, then along the coast to Alaska
had been hard on the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ticket to adventure,&rdquo; she whispered once
again. They had come here, their little party
of four, to begin life anew, to secure for themselves
a home and if possible, a modest fortune.
Would they win? With God&rsquo;s help, could they?
And was true adventure to be thrown in for
good measure? The girl thrilled at the thought,
for, ambitious as she undoubtedly was, she
was human as well, and who does not feel his
blood race at thought of adventure?</p>
<p>However, at this moment something other
than adventure called, the cry of a child in the
night. Florence dearly loved small children.
She could not bear to have them suffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve just got to get out and hunt her up,&rdquo;
she murmured.</p>
<p>With a shudder she dragged her feet from
the warmth of the blankets, slipped on knickers
and shoes, then crept out into the cheerless
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>She did not have far to go. Huddled in a
corner, out of the wind, she discovered two
blanket-wrapped figures. Girls they were, one
small, one large. Indians, she saw as she threw
her light upon their dark faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked, striving to
keep her teeth from chattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog bite her,&rdquo; the older girl spoke in a
slow, deep tone. &ldquo;White man dog. Strange
white man dog. Come steamboat this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence moved closer. &ldquo;We all came
by steamboat. There are many dogs. Too
many! Let me see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small child thrust a trembling hand
from a greasy blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Florence breathed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather
bad. Not very deep, but dog bites are bad.
It must be dressed. I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping quickly to the tent she poured
warm water from a thermos bottle into a basin,
snatched up a first-aid kit, then hurried back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; she said cheerily. &ldquo;First we
wash it. Then we dry it. Then&mdash;this will hurt
a little, quite a bit, I guess.&rdquo; She produced a
bottle of iodine. &ldquo;You tell her. Tell her it will
hurt.&rdquo; She spoke to the older girl, who said
some words in her own language to the attentive
child. When she had finished, Florence
received her first reward&mdash;nor was it to be
the last&mdash;for this bit of personal sacrifice, the
child fixed upon her a look that registered perfect
faith and confidence.</p>
<p>Florence applied the severe remedy. Then
she watched the child&rsquo;s face. A single tear
crept from the corner of her eye and ran down
her cheek.</p>
<p>It hurt, that iodine, hurt terribly for the moment.
Florence knew that. Yet not a muscle
of the child&rsquo;s face moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Florence thought, with a little tightening
at the throat, &ldquo;is the spirit of the North.
It is with this spirit that we all must face the
trials and dangers that lie before us in this
world. If we do this, we shall be real pioneers
and we shall win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall win!&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely, as
standing erect, hands clenched tight, she stood
for a moment facing the bitter Arctic gale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel better now?&rdquo; she asked, dropping
again to the child&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>The child nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now we&rsquo;ll bind it up tight and
it will be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Five minutes later Florence saw the child&rsquo;s
head fall against her older sister&rsquo;s side. Her
pain gone, her cry stilled, she had fallen asleep.
That was Florence&rsquo;s second reward, but not
her last.</p>
<p>As she once more crept beneath the warm
covers in her tent, she felt the slender arms
of Mary, her cousin, close about her and heard
her murmur with a shudder: &ldquo;It is so far and
so cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s talking in her sleep again,&rdquo; Florence
told herself. Then, out of sympathy for the
frailer girl, she too shuddered.</p>
<p>Yes, it had been a long way and even though
it was early June, it was cold. Yet Florence
thrilled at thought of it all. That journey, how
it had unfolded, first on paper, second in their
minds, then in reality!</p>
<p>Mark and Mary had lived with their mother
in the Copper Country of Michigan. Because
she had few relatives and was in need of a
home, Florence had joined them there.</p>
<p>No copper was being mined, so there was
no work and, struggle as they might, they had
grown poorer and poorer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Then had come word of what appeared to
them a wonderful opportunity. The government
was to send two hundred or more families
to the rich Matamuska Valley in Alaska.
They were to be given land and to be loaned
money that they might make a fresh start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pioneers! They will be pioneers in a new
land!&rdquo; Florence, who was of true pioneer
stock, young, sturdy and strong, had exclaimed.
&ldquo;Why should we not go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why, indeed? They had applied, had been
accepted, and here they were at the seaport
of the railroad that was to bear them on to
their new world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; she whispered softly to herself.
&ldquo;Tomorrow, to&mdash;&rdquo; At that she fell fast
asleep.</p>
<p class="tb">If the scene of confusion on the dock at
Anchorage with the trucks, tractors, tents,
and groceries had seemed strange, the picture
before Florence, Mary and Mark a few days
later might, to a casual observer, have seemed
even more strange. Palmer, dream city of the
future, lay before them. And such a city! A
city of tents. Yet, city of tents as it was, it
did not lack signs of excitement. This was
the great day. On this day the future home
owners of this rich valley, surrounded by its
snow-capped mountains, were to draw lots for
their tracts of land. Some tracts were close to
Palmer, some ten or twelve miles away. A
few settlers there were who wished for solitude
in the far-off spots. Many hoped for tracts
close in, where they might walk into town for
their mail and to join in the latest gossip.
Florence, Mary, and Mark had sensed the
bleak loneliness of distant farms during the
long winter. They too hoped for a spot close
at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Florence whispered as, after a long
time of waiting in line, Mark approached the
drawing stand. &ldquo;Now it is your turn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark&rsquo;s hand trembled as it went out. Florence
felt her heart pause, then go leaping. It
meant so much, so very much, that tiny square
of paper with a number on it.</p>
<p>Turning away from the curious throng,
Mark cupped his hand, then together they all
three peered at that magic number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred and twelve!&rdquo; Florence whispered
tensely. &ldquo;Here&mdash;here is our map. Where
is our farm? Here! Here! Let&rsquo;s look!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>One moment of hurried search, then a sigh
of disappointment. &ldquo;Seven miles from town.&rdquo;
Mary dropped limply down upon a stump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have been twelve,&rdquo; Mark said cheerfully.
&ldquo;Bet there&rsquo;s a bear or a moose right in
the middle of it waiting to be made into hamburger.
But then,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t
kill him. Can&rsquo;t get a hunting license for a
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later Mark and Mary with their
mother and Florence close at hand were listening
to a tempting offer. Ramsey McGregor,
a huge man from the western plains, had
drawn a tract of land only a half mile from
town. He had no cow. The Hughes family
owned a cow, a very good milker. If they
would trade tracts of land and throw in the
cow, they might have his farm close to town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of it!&rdquo; Mark cried. &ldquo;Right in town,
you might say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s,&rdquo; Florence agreed. &ldquo;But then&mdash;&rdquo; Already
she had seen quite enough of the noisy,
quarrelsome camp. And besides, there was
the cow. Precious possession, old Boss. Cows
were dear&mdash;milk was hardly to be had at any
price. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; she sighed. Long tramps
through the deep snow, with a wild Arctic
blizzard beating her back, seemed to haunt
her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to decide,&rdquo; she said slowly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be your home. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m only a helper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into this crisis there stepped an angel in disguise,
an unimportant appearing, dark-faced
angel, the older of the two Indian girls Florence
had seen and aided back there at the
dock in Anchorage. Now the girl, approaching
timidly, drew Florence&rsquo;s head down to the
level of her own and whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Florence whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trade,&rdquo; the Indian girl repeated.
&ldquo;Bye and bye I show you.&rdquo; She was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; Mark asked. Mark
was slow, steady, thoughtful, dependable.
Florence had no relative she liked so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says not to trade.&rdquo; There was a look
of uncertainty on the big girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greasy little Indian girl,&rdquo; Ramsey McGregor
growled. &ldquo;What does she know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might know a lot,&rdquo; Mark wrinkled his
brow. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; he turned to the
others. &ldquo;No trade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trade, I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; was Florence&rsquo;s quick
response.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Al&mdash;alright. No trade.&rdquo; Mary swallowed
hard. She had wanted to be near town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you children want,&rdquo; agreed the
meek little mother. Life had pushed her about
so long she was quite willing to take the strong
arm of her son and to say, &ldquo;You lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot like playing a hunch,&rdquo; Mark
laughed uncertainly. &ldquo;After all, the claim we
got is the claim we drew. Looks like God intended
it that way. Besides there&rsquo;s old Boss.
We couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we couldn&rsquo;t do without her,&rdquo; Mary
exclaimed. And so the matter was settled.
Somewhere out there where the sun set would
be their home.</p>
<p>Two hours later Florence and Mary were
enjoying a strange ride. From some unsuspected
source, the Indian girl had secured five
shaggy dogs. These were hitched, not to a
sled, for there was no snow, but to a narrow
three-wheeled cart equipped with auto wheels.
Whence had come those auto wheels? Florence
did not ask, enough that they eased their
way over the bumps along the narrow, uneven
trail that might, in time, become a road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>The land they were passing over fascinated
Mary, who had an eye for the beautiful. Now
they passed through groves of sweet-scented,
low-growing fir and spruce, now watched the
pale green and white of quaking asp, and now
went rolling over a low, level, treeless stretch
where the early grass turned all to a luscious
green, and white flowers stood out like stars.</p>
<p>The surprise of their journey came when,
after passing through a wide stretch of timber,
they arrived quite suddenly upon an open
space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clearing! A cabin! A lake!&rdquo; Mary exclaimed.
&ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed beautiful. True, the clearing
showed signs of neglect, young trees had
sprouted where a field had been, the door of
the cabin, standing ajar, seemed to say, &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s
home. Nobody&rsquo;s been home for many
a day.&rdquo; For all that, the gray cabin, built of
great, seasoned logs, the clearing sloping down
to a small, deep lake, where a flock of wild
ducks swam all unafraid, made a picture one
would not soon forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the Indian girl. A moment
later they stepped in awed silence across the
threshold of the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>The large room they entered was almost
bare. A rustic table, two home-made chairs,
a great sheet-iron barrel, fashioned into a
stove, a few dishes in the corner, a rusted frying
pan and a kettle, that was about all. Yet,
strangely enough, as Florence tiptoed across
the threshold she found herself listening for
the slow tick-tock, tick-tock, of an old-fashioned
clock. With all its desolation there was
somehow about the place an air of &ldquo;home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Mary breathed deeply. Then again,
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stout ladder led to a tall loft where a bed
might, for all they could tell, be waiting. At
the back was a door opening into the small
kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; Florence breathed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; Mary echoed.</p>
<p>Then together they tiptoed out into the sunlight.</p>
<p>Quite unexpectedly, the Indian girl spoke.
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, spreading her arms wide to
take in the cabin, the clearing and the lake beyond,
&ldquo;this is it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thi&mdash;this is what?&rdquo; Mary stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;is your land.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yes, it is your farm.&rdquo; The girl smiled
a happy smile. &ldquo;This is the number you drew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ours!&rdquo; Florence whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;An
abandoned cabin, a clearing, a lake! All ours!
And to think, we nearly missed it!&rdquo; Then,
quite wild with joy, she surprised the shy Indian
girl by catching her up in her arms and
kissing her on the cheek.</p>
<p>At that very moment, as if it were part of
some strange drama, there sounded from the
edge of the clearing a loud: &ldquo;Get up! Go &rsquo;long
there!&rdquo; and a traveling rig as strange as their
own burst from the edge of the timber.</p>
<p>A moment later, a little man on a high-wheeled,
wobbly cart, shouted, &ldquo;Whoa, January!&rdquo;
to his shaggy horse, then sat for a full
moment staring at the three girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re some of them new settlers?&rdquo; he
said at last.</p>
<p>Florence nodded. She was too much surprised
to do more. The man, whose whiskers
had grown for months all untrimmed and
whose hair fell to his shoulders, looked as if
he might have stepped from an illustration of
Rip Van Winkle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This your place?&rdquo; he asked. Again the girl
nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; his eyes swept the horizon, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
lucky maybe&mdash;and then again maybe not.
There&rsquo;s the clearin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the cabin, but maybe
the cabin&rsquo;s haunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, not by ghosts!&rdquo; he held up a hand.
&ldquo;By people who once lived here. It&rsquo;s a notion
of mine, this business of houses being haunted
by living folks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; his voice dropped. &ldquo;Mebby
they&rsquo;re dead. Some sort of foreigners they
was, the ones that lived in this cabin. Came
here durin&rsquo; the war. Lot of queer ones in the
valley them days. Deserters, some of &rsquo;em.
Some dodgin&rsquo; the draft. Some foreign spies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big man, that one,&rdquo; he nodded toward the
cabin. &ldquo;Big woman. Hard workers. Not much
to say for themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day they&rsquo;d gone. Where? Why? No
one knows. Spies, maybe. Government boat
at Anchorage just at that time. Shot &rsquo;em, like
as not, for spies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; the man went on. &ldquo;Might
come back&mdash;Chicaski was the name. Russians.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if they come back, can they claim the
cabin?&rdquo; Florence was thrown into sudden consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o. I guess not. Didn&rsquo;t have no legal
claim on it like as not. There&rsquo;s other deserted
cabins in the valley, lots of &rsquo;em. Folks got discouraged
and quit. Raise plenty of things to
eat. Can&rsquo;t sell a thing. No market. Trap
fox and mink, that&rsquo;s all you can sell. Folks
want things that don&rsquo;t grow on land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to git along,&rdquo; he exclaimed, clucking
to his horse. &ldquo;Live back there five miles, I do.
I&rsquo;ll be seein&rsquo; you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git up! Go &rsquo;long there!&rdquo; The strange little
man gave his shaggy horse a light tap with the
rein and the odd outfit went rattling away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Piper,&rdquo; said the Indian girl, nodding
after the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; Florence
asked in surprise.</p>
<p>The girl nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Mary exclaimed. &ldquo;And did he pick a
peck of prickly pears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian girl stared at her until they all
burst into fits of laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>For all that, it was a sober Florence who
journeyed back to Palmer. Strange words
were passing through her mind. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s
haunted. Raise anything. Can&rsquo;t sell anything.
No market&mdash;you want things that don&rsquo;t grow
on the ground.&rdquo; Her world seemed to have
taken on a whirling motion that, like clouds
blown by the wind, showed first a bright, then
a darker side. What was to come of it all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ticket to adventure,&rdquo; she thought at last.
&ldquo;Perhaps that man was more right than he
knew.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />SEVEN GOLDEN CANDLESTICKS</h2>
<p>Three days later Florence found herself
seated on the shore of the little lake that
lay at the edge of their claim. She was alone.
&ldquo;How still it is,&rdquo; she whispered. Not a leaf
moved. The dark surface of the lake lay before
her like black glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The land of great silence,&rdquo; she thought.
She shuddered and knew not why.</p>
<p>This was to her a strange world. All her
life she had known excitement. The rattle of
elevated trains, the honk of auto horns, the
drum of airplane motors, all these seemed
still to sound in her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rivers,&rdquo; she whispered thoughtfully, &ldquo;have
eddies. There the water that has been rushing
madly on comes to rest. Do lives have eddies?
Has my life moved into an eddy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>She did not enjoy the thought. Adventure,
thrills, suspense, mystery, these were her favorite
words. How could one find them here?
And yet, there was the cabin that lay just up
the rise. Their cabin now, it had belonged to
others. Russians probably, spies perhaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they come back?&rdquo; Mary had whispered
during their return journey from that
first visit. &ldquo;What if they demand the cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll throw them out,&rdquo; Florence had said,
making a savage gesture. &ldquo;I wonder if we
would?&rdquo; had been Mary&rsquo;s reply. Florence wondered
about that now. She wondered about
many things. Why had she come to this
place at all? Because of her love for the
little family, her relatives, Mary, Mark, and
their mother. Could love make people do
things? She wondered. Could it make them
do slow, hard, drudging, everyday things?
If it could, how long would that last?</p>
<p>The thoughts that came to her there were
neither sad nor bitter. They were such dreamy
thoughts as come after a long day of toil. They
had worked, all of them; oh! how they had
worked getting settled!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to go back, back to the city to
the wild romance of many people!&rdquo; she cried
to the empty air of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Then, of a sudden, she realized that she did
not wish to go back, but rather to go on, on,
on, on into the North. For, as she sat there
she seemed to see again the little man, Mr.
Il-ay-ok, and to hear him say, &ldquo;Tom Kennedy,
yes, I know him,&rdquo; and Tom Kennedy was her
long-lost grandfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;and I shall go!&rdquo;
Springing to her feet, she spread her arms
wide. Seeking out the north star, she faced
the land over which it hung. &ldquo;Yes, Tom Kennedy,
my grandfather, I am coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not now&mdash;not now,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;One thing at a time. I have given my word.
I am to help these others win a home. Adventure,
thrills, mystery, romance,&rdquo; she repeated
slowly, &ldquo;can they be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as if in answer to her query, there
came a faint sound. It grew louder, came closer,
the night call of wild geese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how perfect!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;The
lake, the damp night air, the silence, then a
call from the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>She waited. She listened. The speeding
flock came closer. At last they were circling.
They would land. She caught the rush of wings
directly over her head, then heard the faintest
of splashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy landing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But not for long. She was creeping silently
away. They were pioneers. Pioneers lived off
the land. Here was promise of roast goose for
tomorrow dinner. Too bad to spoil romance,
but life must go on.</p>
<p>Slipping up to the cabin, she took Mark&rsquo;s
gun from its place beside the door. With her
heart beating a tattoo against her ribs, she
crept back.</p>
<p>Closer and closer she crept until at last she
lay, quite still, among the tall grass that skirted
the pond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; she whispered to herself.
No answer, save the distant flapping of
wings. How was one to shoot a wild goose he
could not see?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I can wait. There
will be a moon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Wait she did. Once again the strangely silent
night, like some great, friendly ghost,
seemed to enfold her in its arms. Far away
loomed the mountains, close at hand spread
the plains, and over all silence. Only now and
again this silence was broken by the flapping
of wings, a sudden challenging scream, the
call that told her a rich dinner still awaited her.</p>
<p>At last the moon crept over the white crested
mountains. It turned the lake into a sheet
of silver. Dark spots moved across that sheet.
They came closer and closer. Thirty yards
they were from shore, now twenty yards, and
now ten yards. The girl caught one long sighing
breath. Then, bang! Bang! Both barrels
spoke.</p>
<p>A moment later, waist deep, the girl waded
for the shore. In each hand she carried a dead
bird, two big, fat geese. Tomorrow there
would be a feast. Romance? Adventure?
Well, perhaps, a little. But much more was
to come. She felt sure of that now. Her heart
leaped as she hurried forward to meet Mark
and Mary, who were racing toward her demanding
what all the shooting was about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feast!&rdquo; Mary cried joyously. &ldquo;A real pioneer
feast. Thanksgiving in June! The Pilgrim
Fathers have nothing on us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Such a feast as it was! Roast wild goose
with dressing, great brown baked potatoes,
slashed and filled with sweet home-made butter,
all this topped with cottage pudding
smothered in maple sauce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says pioneering is a hard life?&rdquo; Mark
drawled when the meal was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be with such a glorious cook,&rdquo;
Florence smiled at her aunt.</p>
<p>When, at last, she crept up to her bed in the
loft that night, she was conscious of an unusual
stiffness in her joints. Little wonder this,
for all day long she had wielded a grubbing
hoe, tearing out the roots of stubborn young
trees. They were preparing their land for the
plow. They would raise a crop if no one else
among the new settlers did. What crops?
That had not been fully decided.</p>
<p>As Florence lay staring at the shadowy rafters
she fell to musing about what life might
be like if one remained in this valley year after
year. &ldquo;A farm of your own,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;cows, chickens, pigs, a husband, children.&rdquo;
Laughing softly, she turned on her side and
fell asleep.</p>
<p>Five days later their first real visitor arrived.
She was Mrs. Swenson, a short, plump farm
mother and old-time settler of the valley. She
had lived here for fifteen years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Florence, who was churning while Mary
and her mother were away in the town, gave
her an enthusiastic welcome. The handle of
the old-fashioned dasher churn went swish-swash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just keep right on churnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Mrs. Swenson
insisted. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dare stop or the butter
won&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest thing!&rdquo; her eyes roved
about the large room. &ldquo;The Chicaskis&mdash;that
was the name of the people who built this
cabin&mdash;they disappeared, you might say, overnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Did you know them?&rdquo; the swish-swash
stopped for a space of seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes and no,&rdquo; Mrs. Swenson smiled
an odd smile. &ldquo;No one got to know them very
well. They left on foot,&rdquo; she leaned forward
in her chair. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d had a horse. They sold
that to Tim Huston. So away they went, each
of them with satchels in both hands. That&rsquo;s
all they took. It&rsquo;s the strangest thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused. The churn went swish-swash.
The little tin clock in the corner went tick-tick-tick.
Florence&rsquo;s lips parted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Then her visitor spoke again: &ldquo;They had
other things. Wonderful things. A huge copper
kettle and,&rdquo; her voice dropped to a whisper,
&ldquo;seven golden candlesticks. Leastwise, I
always thought they was gold. She always
had &rsquo;em up there above the fireplace, and how
they did shine! Gold! I&rsquo;m sure of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might have took them. Maybe they
did, the candlesticks, I mean. But that huge
copper kettle. They never took that, not in a
satchel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind admitting,&rdquo; Mrs. Swenson&rsquo;s
tone became confidential, &ldquo;that those of us
who&rsquo;ve lived around here ever since have done
a lot of snoopin&rsquo; about this old place, lookin&rsquo;
for that copper kettle and&mdash;and other things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are those who say they hid gold, lots
of Russian, or maybe German gold, around
here somewhere. But, of course, you can&rsquo;t believe
all you hear. And no one has ever
found anything, not even the big copper kettle.
So,&rdquo; she settled back in her chair, &ldquo;perhaps
there&rsquo;s nothing to it after all. Mighty nice
cabin, though,&rdquo; her tone changed. &ldquo;Make you
a snug home in winter. Not like these cabins
the other settlers are building out of green
logs. Them logs are goin&rsquo; to warp something
terrible when they dry. Then,&rdquo; she threw
back her head and laughed, &ldquo;then the children
will be crawlin&rsquo; through the cracks, and with
the temperature at thirty below&mdash;think what
that will be like!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Florence did think. She shuddered at the
very mention of it, and whispered a silent
prayer of thanksgiving to the good God who
had guided them to their snug cabin at the
edge of the clearing beside that gem of a lake.</p>
<p>At thought of it all, she gave herself an
imaginary hug. From without came the steady
pop-pop-pop of a gasoline motor. Mark was
driving a small tractor, plowing their clearing.
They were to have a crop this first year, for it
was still June. Few settlers would have crops.
They were lucky.</p>
<p>She looked at her torn and blistered hand,
then heaved a sigh of content. Those small
trees had been stubborn, some had been
thorny. It had been a heartbreaking job, but
now all that was over. The tractor chugging
merrily outside was music to her weary soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>The tractor? That, too, had been a streak
of luck. Or was it luck? Mark had always
loved fine machinery. Because of this he had
made it his business for years to learn all about
trucks, tractors, mine hoists, motor-boats, and
all else that came within his narrow horizon.
When he had asked down at Palmer about the
use of a tractor the man in charge had said:
&ldquo;Over yonder they are. Not assembled yet.
Put one up and you can use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; Mark grinned. And he
did.</p>
<p>Then they had wanted him to stay and set
up others. He had turned his back on this
promising position with good pay. He had
come to this land to make a home for his family,
and he was determined not to turn back.
So here was the clearing, ten acres nearly
plowed. A short task the harrowing would be.
And then what should they plant?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask Mrs. Swenson about that after a
while,&rdquo; Florence promised herself. Mrs. Swenson
had come a long way and was to stay for
dinner. Florence had raised biscuits and a
large salmon baking in the oven of the stove
they had brought up from Palmer. They were
to have one more royal feast. Three other
guests were to arrive soon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>She smiled as she opened the oven door, releasing
a wave of heat and delightful odors of
cooking things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McQueen&rsquo;s an old dear,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be the godfather of our little settlement.
I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, the newly arrived settler whose land
joined theirs at the back was an interesting
old man. Gray haired and sixty, he stood
straight as a ramrod, six feet four in his stockings.
Strong, brave, wise with the wisdom
that comes only with years, he would indeed
prove a grand counsellor.</p>
<p>And there was Dave, his son, just turned
twenty. &ldquo;Slow, silent, steady going, hard
working, dependable,&rdquo; had been Florence&rsquo;s
instant snap-shot of his character; nor was she
likely to be wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Then, there was Bill Vale, whose land joined
them on the west. How different was Bill! A
dreamer, at twenty-two he was more a boy,
less a man, than Dave. And Bill&rsquo;s mother, who
adored him, agreed with him in every detail.
The girl&rsquo;s brow wrinkled as she thought of
Bill and his mother. How were such people
to get on in a hard, new land? But then, what
was the good of shouldering the problems of
others? They had problems of their own.
What were they to plant? That was their immediate
problem and a large one.</p>
<p class="tb">The meal was over and they were all seated
before the broad, screened door, looking away
at the lake, blue as the sky, when Florence
asked a question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Swenson, what shall we plant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Swenson did not reply at once. The
dinner they had eaten was a rich and jolly
one, just such a dinner as Florence could prepare.
The day was warm. Mrs. Swenson was
fat and chubby. Perhaps she had all but fallen
asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Swenson,&rdquo; Florence repeated, louder
this time, &ldquo;what shall we plant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; the good lady started.
&ldquo;Plant? Why, almost anything. Peas, beans,
carrots, beets, some oats and barley for your
cow. May not get ripe, but you cut it for
fodder. Soy beans are good, too. And potatoes!
You should have seen our potatoes last
year, four hundred bushels on an acre!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Four hundred on an acre!&rdquo; Florence stared.
&ldquo;That would be four thousand on our ten
acres if we planted it all to potatoes. Four
thousand at how much a bushel, Mrs. Swenson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, dear, at nothing at all!&rdquo; Mrs. Swenson
exclaimed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sell &rsquo;em. We
haven&rsquo;t a market. A few go to Fairbanks.
Those are all sold long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No market. There it was again. Florence&rsquo;s
heart sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Potatoes and tomatoes,&rdquo; Mark gave a sudden
start. His face lighted as the earth lights
when the sun slips from behind a cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Swenson, quite emphatically.
&ldquo;Not tomatoes. You&rsquo;ll get huge vines
and blossoms, beautiful blossoms, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomatoes,&rdquo; Mark repeated with a slow,
dreamy smile. &ldquo;Bushels and bushels of tomatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Swenson stared at him in hurt surprise.
&ldquo;No tomatoes,&rdquo; she said again.</p>
<p>Florence favored Mark with a sidewise
glance. She had seen that look on his face
before two or three times and always something
had come of it, something worth while.
Like a song at sunrise, it warmed her heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Then, quite suddenly, the subject was
changed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s the good of a
market. Not just now,&rdquo; Bill Vale drawled.
&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s willing to provide us everything
we need to eat or wear, and a lot of
things besides. Mother and I are getting a
gasoline motor to run the washing machine
and a buzz-saw. No freezing at twenty below
sawing wood for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor me,&rdquo; laughed Dave McQueen. &ldquo;I aim
to work too fast on our old cross-cut saw to
have time to freeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact is, Bill,&rdquo; Mark put in, &ldquo;in the end
we&rsquo;ve got to pay for all these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bill laughed lightly. &ldquo;Got thirty
years to pay, start in five years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the older McQueen drawled. &ldquo;Five
years have rolled round a dozen times in my
lifetime. They all seemed strangely short.
And when the payments start, they&rsquo;ll be coming
round with ominous regularity. Mark and
Florence here have the right idea&mdash;keep debts
down and get proceeds rolling in at the earliest
possible moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomatoes,&rdquo; Mark said dreamily. &ldquo;Bushels
and bush&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>At that they all started to their feet. From
somewhere just out of their view had come the
loud heehaw, heehaw of a donkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Florence sprang out the door.
Then her lips parted in a smile, for there before
her stood one more odd character from
this strange new world: the oddest, she
thought, of them all.</p>
<p>Tall, slim, white-haired, an old man sat
astride a burro. And behind him came two
other burros heavily laden with packs. From
one pack protruded the handles of a pick and
a shovel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A forty-niner,&rdquo; Florence thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real old sourdough Alaskan prospector!&rdquo;
Bill exclaimed, wild with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa! Hello!&rdquo; the old man shouted in
one breath. &ldquo;People livin&rsquo; here! That&rsquo;s bad
for me. I&rsquo;ve been camping here as I came and
went for a long spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The latch-string is still on the outside,&rdquo;
Florence laughed a welcome. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got hot
raised biscuits,&rdquo; she encouraged. &ldquo;Hot raised
biscuits, sweet, home-churned butter and
plenty of coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hot raised biscuits.&rdquo; The man passed a
hand before his eyes. &ldquo;And sweet butter.
Haven&rsquo;t heard those words in twenty years.
Came to Alaska during the rush in &rsquo;97. Just
out of college then. Been prospecting for gold
ever since. Found it twice. It&rsquo;s all gone now.
But there&rsquo;s gold in them hills.&rdquo; His face
lighted as he looked away at the snowy peaks.
&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; he repeated softly. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; his voice
changed, the light in his eyes faded. &ldquo;Sure.
Hot biscuits and sweet butter. Sure, I&rsquo;ll stop
and rest awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, folks,&rdquo; Mark stood looking away at
his partly plowed field. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get back
to work. Season&rsquo;s short. Must get in our
seed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; he slapped the tall boy on the back,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got an acre or two that&rsquo;s nearly
clear. You get busy and root out the brush.
Then I&rsquo;ll plow it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, maybe.&rdquo; Bill scarcely heard. His
eyes were on the prospector&rsquo;s pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about offering the same to us?&rdquo; Dave
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Mark exclaimed. &ldquo;But you got a
hard forty to clear, all timber, looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve picked a spot,&rdquo; Dave drawled.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got strong backs and weak minds,
Dad and I have,&rdquo; he laughed a roaring laugh.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a garden spot ready in two days.
You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence flashed Dave an approving smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McQueen,&rdquo; she said quietly, turning
to Dave&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re having some of the
folks in for a sing Sunday afternoon. Mary will
play our reed organ, you know. Per&mdash;perhaps
you&rsquo;d like to say a few words to the folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I&mdash;&rdquo; the old man hesitated. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
no orator, but I might say a word or
two. Good, old-fashioned time we&rsquo;ll have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure will!&rdquo; Mark agreed.</p>
<p>While the others returned to their work,
Bill lingered behind to talk with the prospector.
After laying out a generous supply of
food, Florence retired to the kitchen and the
dinner dishes. Through the door there drifted
scraps of Bill&rsquo;s talk with the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever really find gold?&rdquo;... &ldquo;Lots of times.&rdquo;...
&ldquo;Boy! That must have been great! I&rsquo;m
getting me a pick and shovel right now.&rdquo;...
&ldquo;Take your time about that, son,&rdquo; the old man
counselled. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s gold. Plenty of it.
I&rsquo;ll find it this time. Sure to.&rdquo; His voice rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any bears up there?&rdquo; Bill asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of &rsquo;em. But I don&rsquo;t bother &rsquo;em and
they don&rsquo;t bother me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d bother them,&rdquo; Bill cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence thought. &ldquo;Bill would
bother them.&rdquo; She remembered the high-powered
rifle that decorated Bill&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Temptation,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;does not belong
to great cities alone. Here boys are
tempted to go after big game, to search for
gold, to chase rainbows.&rdquo; Already Bill&rsquo;s young
brain was on fire.</p>
<p>To her consternation, she suddenly realized
that her blood too was racing. Had she caught
the gleam of gold on the horizon? Would she
listen to the call of wild adventure until it
led her away into those snow-capped mountains?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered fiercely. She had come
to this valley to help those she loved, Mary,
Mark, and their mother, to assist them in securing
for themselves a home. She would
cling to that purpose. She <i>would</i>! She stamped
her foot so hard the dishes rattled and Bill in
the other room gave a sudden start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably thought I was a bear,&rdquo; she
laughed low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Then a thought struck her with the force
of a blow. &ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d been in Alaska since
&rsquo;97. That old man said that,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; She sprang to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister&mdash;er,&rdquo; she hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name&rsquo;s Dale&mdash;Malcomb Dale,&rdquo; the old
man rose and bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Dale,&rdquo; Florence caught her breath.
&ldquo;You said you had been in Alaska a long time.
Did you ever know a man named Tom Kennedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Kennedy! Sure! A fine man, but like
the rest of us.&rdquo; He smiled oddly. &ldquo;A little
touched in the head, you might say, always
looking for gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did&mdash;did he ever find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, once, I&rsquo;m told. Let&rsquo;s see. That was,
well, never mind what year. They found gold,
he and his partner, found it way back of the
beyond, you might say, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; Florence prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they lost it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost&mdash;lost it?&rdquo; Florence stared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;His partner, Dan Nolan, became ill. Tom
Kennedy dragged him all the way to Nome
on a small sled. No dogs. Stormed all that
time. No trail, nothing. Got lost, nearly
froze, but he came through. Powerful man,
Tom Kennedy. Good man, too, best ever.
True a man as ever lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo; Unbidden the words
slipped out.</p>
<p>The prospector stared at her. &ldquo;I said they
lost the mine, never found it again. Nolan
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Tom Kennedy, he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive, far as I know. He&rsquo;s always
hunting that mine. Never found it yet. But
then,&rdquo; the old man sighed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s plenty of
us like that up here where the sun forgets
to set in summer. Gets in your blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he put out a hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get my burros
started. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; his voice was
rich and mellow with years. &ldquo;I shall not forget
you. And when I strike it rich&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated,
then smiled a smile that was like the
sunset, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trade you gold and diamonds for
raised biscuits and sweet butter.&rdquo; He stared
for a moment, as if seeing a vision of the past,
then bowed himself out. He was gone. Bill
went with him. How far he would go the girl
could only guess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Left alone with her thoughts, Florence
found herself wondering about many things.
Was there truly no market for the things they
raised? As the months and years rolled on,
would there still be no market? Fairbanks, a
small city to the north of them, was in need
of many kinds of food. Could they not supply
some of these needs?</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, she recalled Mark&rsquo;s
words, &ldquo;Tomatoes. Bushels and bushels of tomatoes.&rdquo;
Why had he insisted, why repeated
this word, even after Mrs. Swenson had
said, &ldquo;no tomatoes&rdquo;? Mark had something in
mind. What was it? She could not guess, but
dared hope.</p>
<p>She recalled Mrs. Swenson&rsquo;s words about
the mysterious pair that had, with so much
labor, erected this cabin, cleared this land,
then left it all. &ldquo;I wonder why they left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;Seven golden candlesticks,&rdquo; she
murmured, &ldquo;and a great copper kettle. We
could use that kettle.&rdquo; After that, in spite of
her desire to be practical, she found herself
searching the place from foundation to the
loft. All she found was an ancient Dutch oven,
rusted beyond reclaiming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;it <i>is</i> strange
what became of that copper kettle and&mdash;&ldquo; She
did not allow the thought to finish itself.
She had been about to think &ldquo;gold.&rdquo; She knew
that in this land one must not dream&mdash;at least,
not too much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />THE GREAT STUMP</h2>
<p>There was one thing about their little
farm that, from the first time she saw it,
had seemed strange to Florence. Back of the
house stood the stump of a forest giant. Fully
three feet across it stood there, roots embedded
deep, while all about it were pigmies of the
tree world. There was not a tree on the farm
that measured more than thirty feet tall.
Why? Perhaps a fire had destroyed the primeval
forest. Yet here was this great stump.</p>
<p>She tried to picture the tree towering above
its fellows. She found herself wishing that it
had not been felled by some woodsman&rsquo;s axe.
Why had they cut it down? That they might
build its logs into the house was a natural
answer, yet the house contained no such logs.
Well, here was a riddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>On top of the stump the original dwellers
in the cabin had placed a massive flower-box.
Somehow, they had secured wild morning-glory
seeds and planted them there. These
must, from year to year, have replanted themselves,
for, even in June, the vines were beginning
to droop over the edge of the box.
By autumn the great stump would be a mass
of flowers. However others might regard
wild morning-glories, Florence knew she
would adore them.</p>
<p>She was standing staring at the stump and
thinking of it with renewed wonder when
Mark came in from his plowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! That&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he exclaimed as he
dropped down upon a bench. &ldquo;Now for the
planting.&rdquo; Then, to his cousin&rsquo;s renewed astonishment,
he said. &ldquo;Bushels and bushels of
tomatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark!&rdquo; exclaimed Florence. &ldquo;Why do you
keep on insisting that we can raise tomatoes
here when Mrs. Swenson, who has lived here
so long, says we can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we can,&rdquo; Mark grinned broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and stop staring at that stump
as if it hid some strange secret and I&rsquo;ll tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Florence sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the way I have of poking about
in all sorts of odd corners wherever I am,&rdquo;
Mark began. &ldquo;Well, while we were in Anchorage
I got to prowling round and stumbled
upon a small greenhouse set way back on
a side street where very few people would
see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know you&rsquo;ll always find something
interesting in a greenhouse. Some new
vegetable or flower, a strange form of moss or
fungus, or even a new species of plant pest.
So I went in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found tomato plants all in blossom, dozens
and dozens of them in pots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I asked the man&mdash;why? He
said he&rsquo;d raised them for some gardener in a
town down south, half way to Seattle. Something
had gone wrong with the man or his
garden. He couldn&rsquo;t use them so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they were.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mark agreed with uncommon enthusiasm.
&ldquo;There they were, and there, I am
quite sure, they are still. They can be bought
cheap, probably four hundred plants in pots.
Must be tomatoes big as marbles on them by
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know,&rdquo; he went on excitedly,
&ldquo;when you set out potted plants the blossoms
and small tomatoes do not drop off, they just
keep on growing. And here, where the sun
will be shining almost twenty-four hours a
day, they should just boom along. Have ripe
tomatoes in six weeks. Then how those well-to-do
people in Anchorage, Seward and Fairbanks
will go after them! Tomatoes!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
spreading his arms wide. &ldquo;Bushels
and bushels of tomatoes; ripe, red gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if there is a frost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mark said with a drop in his voice.
&ldquo;A June frost. That happens sometimes. It&rsquo;s
a chance we&rsquo;ll have to take. I&rsquo;m going to Anchorage
for those plants tomorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; his voice dropped, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see
all this going in debt for the things you eat
and wear, to say nothing of tools, machinery,
and all that. It&rsquo;s got to be paid sometime and
it&rsquo;s going to come hard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right if you have to do it, better
than getting no start at all. I&rsquo;m not criticising
anyone else. But, as for the Hughes family,
we&rsquo;re going to pay as we go if we can, and
who knows but those tomatoes will pay for
our winter&rsquo;s supply of flour, sugar, and all the
rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Florence echoed enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Six weeks had passed when once again Florence
sat beside the lake. There was a moon
tonight. It hung like a magic lantern above
the snow-capped mountain. The lake reflected
both mountains and moon so perfectly that
for one who looked too long, it became not
a lake at all, but mountains and moon.</p>
<p>Florence had looked too long. She was
dreaming of wandering among those jagged
peaks in an exciting search. A search for
gold. And why not? Had not the aged prospector
appeared once more at their door? Had
she not feasted him on hot-cakes and wild
honey? Had he not repaid her with fresh
tales of her grandfather&rsquo;s doings in the very
far north?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go in search of him,&rdquo; she told herself
now. &ldquo;A search for a grandfather,&rdquo; she
laughed. Well, why not? He had lost a rich
gold mine. She was strong as a man, was
Florence. No man, she was sure, could follow
a dog team farther nor faster than she.
She would find Tom Kennedy and together
they would find that mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first this!&rdquo; she sighed as on other occasions,
flinging her arms wide to take in the
claim, the lake, and the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First what?&rdquo; a voice close at hand said.</p>
<p>Startled, she sprang to her feet. &ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s
you, Mark.&rdquo; She made a place for him beside
her on a broad flat rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First your little farm,&rdquo; she said soberly.
&ldquo;Tomatoes and potatoes and all the rest. A
shelter for old Boss, everything that will go
to make this a home for you and Mary and
your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; Mark&rsquo;s voice was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not for me, Mark. For you this is
life. I understand that. I admire you for it.
To have a home, and a small farm, to add to
that year after year, to change the log cabin
for a fine home, to have cattle and sheep and
broad pasture and&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated, then went
on, &ldquo;and children, boys and girls, happy in
their home. All this is your life and will be
years on end. But for me, it is only&mdash;what
should I say&mdash;an episode, one adventure
among many, a grand and glorious experience.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mark said, and there was kindness
in his voice. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose that is it. Awfully
good of you to share the hardest year with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean hardest?&rdquo; Florence demanded.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been glorious. And we are succeeding
so well. Already the tomatoes are up
to my shoulders. What a crop they will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mark&rsquo;s voice was husky. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time there was silence. Then Mark
spoke again. &ldquo;There was a time, and not so
long ago, when I thought to myself, &lsquo;Life&rsquo;s
stream must grow darker and deeper as we
go along.&rsquo; But now&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo; he did not finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Florence laughed from sheer joy of
living. &ldquo;Now you must know that it grows
lighter and brighter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lighter and brighter,&rdquo; Mark laughed softly.
&ldquo;Those are fine words, mighty fine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re grand words,&rdquo; the girl cried. &ldquo;True
words, too. It&mdash;why, life is like a summer
morning! Only day before yesterday I went
out to find old Boss before dawn. It was
more than half dark. Clouds along the horizon
were all black. They looked ominous,
threatening. Soon, some power behind them
began to set them on fire. Redder and redder
they shone, then they began to fade. Salmon
colored, deep pink, pale pink, they faded and
faded until like a ghost&rsquo;s winding sheet they
vanished. Lighter and brighter. Oh, Mark!
how grand and beautiful life can be!&rdquo; Leaping
to her feet she did a wild dance, learned
in some gypsy camp with her good friend,
Petite Jeanne; then, dropping to her place beside
the boy, she looked away into the night.
For her, darkness held no terror, for well she
knew there should be a brighter dawn.</p>
<p>Of a sudden, as they sat there, each busy
with thoughts of days that were to come, they
were startled by a sudden loud splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence jumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only some big old land-locked salmon,&rdquo;
Mark chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they were here? Oh, sure! I&rsquo;ve heard
them before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mark, I love to fish. Couldn&rsquo;t we fix up
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. There&rsquo;s a line or two in the cabin
and some three gang hooks. I&rsquo;ll cut the handle
off a silver-plated spoon. It&rsquo;ll spin all
right without the handle. That&rsquo;ll fool &rsquo;em.
You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did see. The very next day she saw
what Mark&rsquo;s inventive skill would do and,
seeing, she found fresh adventure that might
have ended badly had not some good angel
guided one young man to an unusually happy
landing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />HAPPY LANDING</h2>
<p>Dull gray as a slate roof, the lake lay
before Florence next morning. There
was a threat of rain. From time to time, like
scurrying wild things, little ripples ran across
the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the time for a try at that big old
salmon trout,&rdquo; she exulted.</p>
<p>They had a boat, of a sort. A great hollow
log brought down from the hills, with its ends
boarded up. It leaked, and it steered like a
balky mule, but what of that? She would have
a try at trolling.</p>
<p>Dropping on her knees at the back of the
boat, she seized the paddle, then went gliding
out across the gray, rippling water. Quite
deftly she dropped in her silver spoon and
played out her line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>After that, for a full quarter hour, she paddled
about in ever-widening circles. Once
her heart skipped a beat. A strike! No, only a
weed. She had come too near the shore. Casting
the weed contemptuously away, she struck
out for deeper water.</p>
<p>Round and round she circled. Darker grew
the surface of the lake. Going to rain, all
right. Clouds were closing in, dropping lower
and lower. Well, let it rain. Perhaps&mdash;</p>
<p>Zing! What was that? Something very
like a sledge-hammer hit her line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Oh, gee! No.&rdquo; He was gone.</p>
<p>Was he, though? One more wild pull. Then
again a slack line. What sort of fish was this?</p>
<p>Line all out. She would take in a little slack.
Her hand gripped the line when again there
came that mighty tug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got you,&rdquo; she hissed.</p>
<p>And so she had, but for how long? The
line, she knew, was strong enough. But the
rod and reel? They were mere playthings.
Bought for perch and rock bass, not for thirty-pound
salmon. Would they do their part? She
was to see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Dropping her paddle, she settled low in her
uncertain craft. A sudden rush of the fish
might at any moment send her plunging into
the lake. Not that she minded a ducking. She
was a powerful swimmer. But could one land
a salmon that way? She doubted this. And
she did want that fish. What a grand feast!
She&rsquo;d get a picture, too. Send it to her friends&mdash;who
believed her lost in a hopeless wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to get you.&rdquo; She began
rolling in. The reel was pitifully small. She
had not done a dozen turns when the tiny handle
slipped from her grasp.</p>
<p>Zing! sang the reel. Only by dropping the
rod between her knees and pressing hard
could she halt the salmon&rsquo;s mad flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;I got you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, throwing all the strength of her
capable hands into the task, she reeled in
until, with a sudden rush the fish broke water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; she stared. &ldquo;What a beauty!
But look! You&rsquo;re up, head, tail and all. How&rsquo;re
you hooked, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could discover the answer he was
down and away. Once again the reel sang.
Once more its handle bored a hole in her right
knee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dum!&rdquo; she exclaimed as her boat began
to move. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s heading for the weeds. He&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
snag himself off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat gained momentum. Reel as she
might, the fish gained ground. Deep under the
surface were pike-weeds. She knew the spot,
twenty yards away, perhaps. Now fifteen.
Now&mdash;</p>
<p>Wrapping the line about her shoe, she seized
the paddle and began paddling frantically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! That gets you.&rdquo; Slowly, reluctantly,
the fish gave ground. Then, driven to madness,
he broke water a full fifty yards from
the boat. This move gave the line a sudden
slack. The boat shot sidewise and all but overturned.
In a desperate effort to right herself,
the girl dropped her paddle. Before the boat
had steadied itself the paddle was just out of
her reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you! I&rsquo;ll get you if I have to swim
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time, quite unknown to the girl,
something was happening in the air as well
as the water. There was the sound of heavy
drumming overhead. Now it lost volume, and
now picked up, but never did it quite end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Without a paddle, with her reel serving her
badly, the girl was driven to desperation.
Seizing the line, she began pulling it in hand
over hand. This was a desperate measure; the
line might break, the hook might loose its
grip. No matter. It was her only chance.</p>
<p>Yard by yard the line coiled up in the bottom
of the boat. And now, of a sudden, the
thunder of some powerful motor overhead
grew louder. Still, in her wild effort to win
her battle, the girl was deaf to it all.</p>
<p>The line grew shorter and shorter, tighter
and tighter. What a fish! Thirty yards away,
perhaps, now twenty. Now&mdash;how should she
land him? She had no gaff.</p>
<p>That question remained unanswered, for at
that instant things began to happen. The fish,
in a last mad effort to escape, leaped full three
feet in air. This was far too much for the
crazy craft. Over it went and with it went
the girl.</p>
<p>That was not all; at the same instant a dark
bulk loomed out of the clouds to come racing
with the speed of thought towards the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&mdash;an airplane,&rdquo; she gasped. Closing her
eyes, she executed a sudden dive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>This action would have proved futile, the
pontoons of the plane sank deep. Fortunately,
they passed some thirty feet from the spot
where the girl disappeared.</p>
<p>When she rose sputtering to the surface,
her first thought was of the fish. No use. The
line was slack, the salmon gone.</p>
<p>She looked up at the plane. At that moment
a young aviator was peering anxiously out
over the fuselage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! There you are!&rdquo; he beamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
awfully glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look where you&rsquo;re going?
You cut my line. I lost my fish.&rdquo; Florence
was truly angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish? Oh, I see! You were fishing?&rdquo; The
young aviator stood up. He was handsome
in an exciting sort of way. &ldquo;But I say!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix that. I&rsquo;ve a whole leg of
venison here in my old bus. What do you say
we share it? Can you bake things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but my aunt can do it much better.&rdquo;
Florence climbed upon a pontoon to shake the
water out of her hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Five hours later, with the rain beating a
tattoo on the well weathered roof of the cabin,
they were seated about the hand-hewn table,
the Hughes family, Florence, and the young
aviator. Seven candles winked and blinked on
the broad board. At the head sat Mark, and
before him the first roast of wild venison the
family had ever tasted. How brown and juicy
it was!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Florence murmured. &ldquo;How
did you get it?&rdquo; the words slipped unbidden
from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No secret about that,&rdquo; Speed Samson, the
aviator, smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a guide. Take people up
into the mountains for fish and game. Just
left a party up there. Going back in a week.
It&rsquo;s wonderful up there. Snow. Cold. Refreshing.
Great! Want to go along?&rdquo; He
looked at Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take you all,&rdquo; his eyes swept them in a
circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done just now. Thanks all the
same.&rdquo; It was Mark who spoke. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re new
here. Lots to do. Adventure will have to
wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he hastened to add, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
talking for Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you are!&rdquo; the big girl flashed back.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in this game the same as you, at least
until snow flies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.!&rdquo; the aviator laughed. &ldquo;When snow
flies I&rsquo;ll be back. Winter up here is the time
for adventure.&rdquo; He was looking now at Mary,
whose dark eyes shone like twin stars. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take you for a long, long ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant something rattled against
the windowpane. Was it sleet driven by the
rain or was it some spirit tapping a message,
trying to tell Mary how long and eventful
that ride would really be?</p>
<p>Next day the smiling aviator went sailing
away into a clear blue sky. Florence and Mary
went back to their work, but things were not
quite the same. They never are after one has
dreamed a bright dream.</p>
<p>Three days later, Florence got her fish, or
was it his brother? He weighed twenty
pounds. Of course that called for one more
feast. Fortunately, one who works hard may
enjoy a feast every day in the year and never
waste much time. Truth is, only one who <i>does</i>
work hard can truly enjoy any feast to its
full. The Hughes family enjoyed both work
and wonderful food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />A WANDERER RETURNS</h2>
<p>Florence stirred uneasily beneath the
blankets. Morning was coming. A faint
light was creeping in over the cabin loft where
she and Mary slept in a great, home-made bed.</p>
<p>More often than not it is a sound that disturbs
our late slumbers. Florence had never
become quite accustomed to the morning
sounds about their little farm. All her life she
had lived where boats chug-chugged in the
harbor and auto horns sounded in the streets.
Here more often than not it was the croak of
a raven, the song of some small bird, the wild
laugh of a loon on the lake that awoke her.</p>
<p>Now, as a sharp suggestion of approaching
winter filled the air, on more than one morning
it was the quack-quack of some old gander
of the wild duck tribe, flown to the lake from
the far North, or the honk-honk of geese.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>All this was music to the nature-loving girl&rsquo;s
ear. And, of late, all of life seemed to her a
great symphony full of beautiful melodies.
The hard battle of summer was over. Bravely
the battle had been fought. The Hughes family
had come to this valley to win themselves
a home. She was one of them, in spirit at
least. The beginning they had made surpassed
their expectations. Now, as she opened her
eyes to find herself fully awake, she thought
of it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ticket to adventure,&rdquo; she whispered low
to herself, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what the man said he was
giving me. It&rsquo;s been a ticket to duty and endless
labor. And yet,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
complaining.&rdquo; A great wave of contentment
swept over her. They were secure for the
winter. That surely was something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; she laughed, silently. &ldquo;Bill
has had the adventure. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts broke off. From somewhere,
all but inaudible, a sound had reached her ear.
More sensation than sound, she knew at once
that it was made by no wild thing. But what
could it be? She listened intently, but, like a
song on their little battery radio, it had faded
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Yes&mdash;her thoughts went back to her neighbor&mdash;Bill
Vale had sought adventure and had
found it. With his mother still in Palmer, he
had packed up a generous supply of food,
charged to his mother&rsquo;s account at the government
commissary, and joining up with the
dreamy-eyed prospector, Malcomb Dale, had
gone away into the hills searching for gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that Bill&rsquo;s mother would have objected,&rdquo;
Florence thought. &ldquo;She would have said,
&lsquo;Bill is incurably romantic. The quest for gold
appeals to him. All our desires in the end
must be satisfied if we are to enjoy the more
abundant life. Besides, what is there to do?
There are six hundred men working in gangs.
They will clear up our land for us and build
cabins before snow flies. We shall be charged
with it all, but then we have thirty years to
pay.&rsquo; Yes, that is exactly what Bill&rsquo;s mother
would have said,&rdquo; and the thought disgusted
Florence not a little.</p>
<p>So Bill had gone away into the mountains.
The mountains, those glorious, snow-capped
mountains! Florence, as she bent over her
work in their large garden, had watched him
start. And as she saw him disappear, she had,
for the moment, envied him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Often and often, in the sweet cool of the
evening, she and Mary had talked about how,
in some breathing spell, they would borrow a
horse and go packing away into those mountains.
The breathing spell had never come.
And now, the brief autumn was here. Winter
was just around the corner. Florence had no
regrets. Never before had she felt so happy
and secure.</p>
<p>Bill had been gone six weeks. The clearing
and building crew had arrived while he was
away. There was dead and down timber at
the back of Bill&rsquo;s lot that would have made a
fine, secure cabin, had Bill been there to point
it out. He was not there. So the cabin was
built of green logs. Already you could see
daylight through the cracks, and Bill&rsquo;s mother,
who had moved in with what to Florence
seemed an unnecessary amount of furniture
and equipment, was complaining bitterly about
&ldquo;the way the government has treated us poor
folks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Bill had returned at last. Sore-footed and
ragged, his food gone, his high-priced rifle red
with rust, he had returned triumphant. He
had found gold. In the spring he would begin
operations in a big way. Proudly he displayed
six tiny nuggets, none of them bigger than a
pea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeds,&rdquo; old John McQueen had called
them. &ldquo;Golden seeds of discontent.&rdquo; But to
Bill they were marvelous. For him they hid
the cracks in their cabin, his unplowed field,
his uncut woodpile. And, because she doted
on her son, they hid all these things from his
mother&rsquo;s eyes as well&mdash;at least, for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Bill!&rdquo; Florence sighed, as she snuggled
down beneath the blankets. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a
dreamer. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was that strange sound again, like a
speedboat motor. She laughed at the thought
of a speedboat on their tiny lake. But now,
as before, it faded away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Yes, with her help, the Hughes family had
won. Their summer had been a complete success.
How they had worked, morning to
night. Mosquitoes and flies, tough sod and
weeds, they had battled them all. And how
they had been rewarded! Never had plants
grown and flourished as theirs did. Mark&rsquo;s tomatoes
were a complete success. Twice, it was
true, the mercury dropped to a point perilously
near freezing and their heads rested on
uneasy pillows. But the Alaskan weather man
had been kind. Their bright red harvest,
&ldquo;bushels and bushels of tomatoes,&rdquo; had come
and had been sold at unbelievable prices. All
along the Alaskan railroad, people had gone
wild about their marvelous tomatoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; the girl heaved another happy
sigh. Now their little sodded-in cellar was
packed full of potatoes, beets, turnips, and
carrots; their shelves were lined with home-canned
wild fruit, raspberries, blueberries,
high bush cranberries, and their storeroom
crowded with groceries, all paid for. What
was more, a horse! &ldquo;Old Nig,&rdquo; bought from
a discouraged settler, was in their small log
barn. It was marvelous, truly marvelous! And
yet, in this wild land full of possible exciting
events, they had known no adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duty first,&rdquo; John McQueen had said to her
once. &ldquo;And when duty is done, let adventure
come as it may. And it <i>will</i> come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old McQueen,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;God
surely knows all our needs. He sends us such
men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Suddenly her feet hit the floor with a bound.
She had heard that sound once more. It was
the drum of an airplane motor. She judged by
the sound that it was circling for a landing,
perhaps on their little lake. How wonderful!
Was it their friend, the young aviator? Had
he come for them? Her blood raced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; she fairly screamed. &ldquo;Wake up!
An airplane! And it&rsquo;s going to land. It&rsquo;s landing
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They jumped into their clothes and were
out on the cabin steps just in time to see the
beautiful blue and gray airplane, graceful as
any wild fowl, circle low to a perfect landing.</p>
<p>With mad scurrying, wild ducks and geese
were off the water and away on the wing,
leaving the intruders to the perfect quiet of a
glorious autumn morning.</p>
<p>A short time later they were all at the
water&rsquo;s edge, Florence, Mary, Mark, Bill, and
Dave. The hydroplane had been anchored.
Three men had just put off in a small boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, there,&rdquo; one of them shouted. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
the chances for sourdough pancakes and coffee?&rdquo;
It was Speed Samson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Florence laughed. &ldquo;Plate of hots
coming up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is not to be our trip.&rdquo; There was a
note of disappointment in Florence&rsquo;s tone as
she murmured these words to Mary. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
got a hunting party. Probably going after
moose or grizzly bears.&rdquo; Nevertheless, she
was ready enough to offer to the party the true
hospitality of the north. Soon their plates
were piled high with cakes, their cups steaming
with fragrant brown coffee.</p>
<p>As Florence sat talking to them, one of the
men, all rigged out in hunting belt filled with
shells, riding breeches and high boots, seemed
familiar to her. Who was he? For the life of
her, she could not think.</p>
<p>It was Mary who dispelled her doubt. &ldquo;Florence,&rdquo;
once they were alone in the kitchen, she
gripped her arm hard, &ldquo;that man&rsquo;s the one who
roared at the little Eskimo, Mr. Il-ay-ok, back
there on the dock in Anchorage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s whisper rose shrill
and high. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him and I don&rsquo;t think I
ever shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he hate that little man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Florence answered hastily.
&ldquo;Anyway, his name is Peter Loome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Florence did not catch this, she was already
hurrying away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re bound for the big-game hunting
ground,&rdquo; one of the men was explaining to
Mark. &ldquo;Wonderful sport! Wild sheep and
goats, moose and big brown bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, you&rsquo;re lucky!&rdquo; Bill exclaimed.</p>
<p>Mark made no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your motor don&rsquo;t sound just right,&rdquo; Mark
said as the conversation lagged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with it?&rdquo; the young pilot
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t quite tell,&rdquo; Mark puckered his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever fly?&rdquo; The pilot looked at him sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o. But then your motor&rsquo;s just like the
ones we had in some speedboats back in the
Copper Country. I tinkered with them. You
get to know by the sound,&rdquo; Mark replied modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to turn her over once or twice?&rdquo; the
pilot invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Be glad to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later grim, greasy, but triumphant,
Mark emerged from the plane. He had
located the trouble and had remedied it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say-ee, you&rsquo;re good!&rdquo; the pilot was enthusiastic.
&ldquo;Want to go along as my mechanic?
Grand trip! Shoot goats, bears, moose, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get away just now,&rdquo; said Mark quietly.
&ldquo;Thanks all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just the same, there was a look of longing
in his eye that Florence knew all too well.
He had two passions, had Mark. He loved
growing things and wonderful machinery.
Growing was over for this year. Dull, dreary
days of autumn were at hand. For him, to
spend two weeks or even a month watching
over that matchless motor would be bliss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; he repeated slowly, almost mournfully.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go. There is still work to be
done before snow flies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; Bill put in. &ldquo;Take me. I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know anything about motors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, a lot,&rdquo; Bill, never too modest, replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Get your things.&rdquo; A half hour
later, Bill sailed off to one more adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence thought with a grim smile.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s spent two weeks felling green trees to
cut with his new buzz-saw. Be fine wood in
twelve months. But how about next January?
Poor Bill!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Strange to say, the one thought that often
haunted both Florence and Mary was the
realization that their splendid cabin had been
built by someone else. That this someone had
hidden a big copper kettle and, perhaps, seven
golden candlesticks near the cabin, then had
gone away, did not seem to matter. &ldquo;What
if they should come back?&rdquo; Florence asked
herself over and over.</p>
<p>Then, one bright autumn day, their dark
dream came true. Busy in the kitchen, Florence
did not notice the approach of a stranger.
Only when she heard heavy footsteps outside
did she hurry into the large front room. Then,
through the open door, she heard a loud sigh,
followed by the creak of a bench as a heavy
person settled upon it. After that, in a voice
she could not mistake, though she had never
heard it before, there came: &ldquo;Ah! Home at
last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam Chicaski, the original owner of the
cabin,&rdquo; the girl thought in wild consternation.
&ldquo;She has returned!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />AND THEN CAME ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>When you buy a house, or even a cabin
in the wilderness, how much of it do
you really buy? All of it or only part? The
walls, the roof, the floor, surely all these are
yours. But all those other things, the little
cupboard in the corner, all carved out from
logs with crude tools, but done so well for
someone who has been loved&mdash;do you buy
this too? And all the other delicate touches
that made a house a home, can you buy these
or do you only try to buy these and fail? It
was thus that Florence thought as she sat
dreaming in the sun outside the cabin.</p>
<p>From within came the sound of voices. Her
aunt and Madam Chicaski were talking. Already
her aunt had come to love the company
of this huge Russian woman who had first
made this cabin into a home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>A week had passed and still the woman lingered.
How long would she stay? No one
knew nor seemed to care overmuch. She insisted
on working, this stout old woman. And
how she did work! When Mark began going
to the forest cutting dead trees and dragging
them in with the tractor for the winter&rsquo;s supply
of wood, she shouldered an axe and went
along. Then how the trees came crashing
down! Even Mark was no match for her. In
five days a great pile of wood loomed up beside
the cabin. High time, too, for the first flurry
of snow had arrived.</p>
<p>That Madam Chicaski had a gentler side
they learned as she talked beside the fire in
the long evenings. She told of her own adventure
on this very spot when the valley was
all but unknown and life for her was new.
Many things she told, tales that brought forth
smiles and tears.</p>
<p>One subject she never touched upon, nor
was she asked to tell, what had become of the
great copper kettle, the seven golden candlesticks
and all else that had been left behind.
&ldquo;If she stays long enough, in time I shall
know,&rdquo; Florence assured herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>There were other things she did not tell.
Why had she left the valley and how? Where
was her husband now? This much was certain,
she was not now in want. Florence had come
upon her one afternoon unobserved. She was
thumbing a large roll of bills. At the slightest
sound she concealed them under her ample
dress.</p>
<p>At times she acted strangely. She would
go to the back of the yard and stand, for a
quarter hour or more, contemplating the great
stump. Over this, during the summer, morning-glories
had bloomed in profusion. At that
moment it was covered only by dry and rustling
vines. At such times as this on the Russian
woman&rsquo;s face was a look of devotion.
&ldquo;Like one saying her prayers,&rdquo; Florence
thought.</p>
<p>There came a day when, for a time at least,
all thoughts of the mysterious Madam Chicaski
were banished from the little family&rsquo;s
thoughts. Mystery was replaced by thrilling
adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Once again the air was filled with sound. A
large, gray hydroplane came zooming in from
the west. They were waiting at the water&rsquo;s
edge, the Hughes family and Madam, when
the pilot taxied his plane close in to shore.
Florence was not there. She was away on a
visit to Palmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to paddle out and get
me?&rdquo; the pilot invited as he climbed out upon
the fuselage.</p>
<p>Mark rowed out in their small home-made
skiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on an errand of mercy,&rdquo; the man explained
at once, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to need some
help. Just received a message by short-wave
radio that some men are in trouble up in the
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunters?&rdquo; Mark suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a blue and gray plane?&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s dark
eyes widened. How about Bill, she was thinking.
Despite his shortcomings, Bill held a
large place in slender Mary&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any&mdash;any one hurt?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the hunters has been badly handled
by a bear,&rdquo; the man went on. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s
gone wrong with their motor, too. They can&rsquo;t
bring him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear?&rdquo; said Mark. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sure to be Bill.
He&rsquo;d march right up and shoot a bear in the
eye.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, it must be Bill,&rdquo; Mary exclaimed,
striving in vain to control her emotions.
&ldquo;We must do something to help him.
What can we do?&rdquo; Months shut away from
the outside world had drawn their little company
close together. Bound by bonds of
friendship and mutual understanding, despite
the faults of some, they were very close to one
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can help a great deal,&rdquo; said the pilot,
&ldquo;that is,&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re willing to
take a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a chance?&rdquo; Mary stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the man smiled, &ldquo;you look like a
good nurse. Your brother, here, I am told, is
a fine motor mechanic. Climb in the plane and
come along with me&mdash;both of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ticket to adventure!&rdquo; The words so
often repeated now echoed in Mary&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; Mark turned to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there&rsquo;s still work to be done,&rdquo; she
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work can wait. This appears a plain
call of duty.&rdquo; Mark&rsquo;s voice trembled ever so
slightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right. We&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; Mary felt a thrill
course up her spine. At the same instant she
caught the eye of Dave Kennedy. In those fine
eyes she read something quite wonderful, a
look of admiration and yet of concern.</p>
<p>She and Dave had become great friends.
Dave was a wonderful fellow. His Scotch
mother was small, quite frail, yet altogether
lovely. When their logs in their cabin walls
had begun to warp, Dave and his father had
sodded it up, quite to the eaves. Now they
were all set for winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after your horse and cow and&mdash;and
cut the wood,&rdquo; Dave said huskily. &ldquo;I only
wish I might take your place.&rdquo; He looked
Mary squarely in the eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she laughed, looking
away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will be a wonderful adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold up there,&rdquo; suggested the pilot. &ldquo;We
shall need blankets and food. We may have
to freeze in and fly out on skis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hughes family was not stingy. A huge
cart-load of supplies was carried to the water&rsquo;s
edge, then ferried to the airplane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I stay,&rdquo; said stout Madam Chicaski. &ldquo;I
stay until you come back. I look after everything.&rdquo;
Mary&rsquo;s heart warmed to this powerful
old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; she screamed as the motor thundered.
&ldquo;Goodbye, everyone.&rdquo; A moment later,
for the first time in her life, she was rising
toward the upper spaces where clouds are
made.</p>
<p>The moments that followed will ever remain
like the memory of a dream in the girl&rsquo;s
mind. Though the motor roared, they appeared
to be standing still in mid-air while
a strangely beautiful world glided beneath
them. Here a ribbon that was a stream wound
on between dark green bands that were
fringes of forest, here a tiny lake mirrored
the blue sky, there a broad stretch of swamp-land
lay brown and drear, while ever before
them, seeming to beckon them on&mdash;to what,
to service or to death?&mdash;were the snow-capped
mountains.</p>
<p>So an hour passed. Swamps vanished. Jagged
rocks appeared. Hemlock and spruce,
dark as night, stood out between fields of glistening
snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>And then, with a quick intake of breath,
Mary sighted a tiny lake. Half hidden among
rocky crags, it seemed the most marvelous
part of this dream that was not a dream. And
yes&mdash;clutching at her breast to still her heart&rsquo;s
wild beating, she shouted to her silent, awe-struck
brother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was she wrong. With a sudden thundering
swoop that set her head spinning, the
powerful ship of the air circled low for a landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; she breathed, and again, &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One instant it seemed they would graze the
rocks to the left of them, the next the bank
of trees to the right. And then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Mark shouted suddenly.</p>
<p>As the pontoons of the plane touched the
surface of the lake, there had come a strange
ripping sound.</p>
<p>They had not long to wait for the answer.
Hardly had the airplane taxied to a spot
twenty feet from a shelving bank, when the
plane began settling on one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tough luck!&rdquo; exclaimed the pilot. &ldquo;A little
ice formed on the lake. Must have punctured
a pontoon. No real danger, I guess.
Those fellows should be here any&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! There they are now!&rdquo; Mary
exclaimed, pointing to a spot where two men
were putting off in a small boat.</p>
<p>The boat, she saw at once, was one used on
their own small lake not so many days before.
In a narrow cove she sighted the blue and
gray airplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; laughed their pilot. &ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl thought soberly. &ldquo;Here we
are. Two hundred miles from anywhere in a
frozen wilderness. Two disabled airplanes.
Food for a month. One injured boy. Fine outlook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The instant her eyes fell upon the men in
the boat she experienced one more shock.
Peter Loome, the man with a hard face, who
hated all Eskimos, was there. She barely suppressed
a shudder. Just why she feared and
all but hated this man she was not able at that
moment to say.</p>
<p>She was not one to see the dull gray side
of life&rsquo;s little cloud for long. The instant they
reached the improvised camp she asked after
the injured person and was not surprised to
find that it was Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That bear,&rdquo; Bill drawled as she dressed the
rather deep wounds on his arms and chest,
&ldquo;took an unfair advantage of me. He could
run a lot faster&rsquo;n any man. And he ran the
wrong way. Funny part was, when he got up
with me, he wanted to hug me. If he hadn&rsquo;t
been badly hurt, he&rsquo;d have killed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d left him alone in the first place,
probably he wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered you,&rdquo;
Mary said soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, probably not,&rdquo; Bill replied ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; one of the hunters consoled him,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have his skin for a rug back there in
your cabin this winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; Bill exploded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been cold
long enough. That cabin leaks air. Soon&rsquo;s I
get back I&rsquo;ll be startin&rsquo; for old Alabam&rsquo;, or at
least some place that&rsquo;s warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary frowned but said nothing. Already she
had come to love that valley where their cabin
stood by the little lake. If it was her good
fortune to return there in safety she would
not ask for more. As for Bill, he had, she
thought, brought all his troubles upon himself.
But Bill was wounded and ill. What he
needed, at the moment, was kindness and gentle
care, not advice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>That night Mary and Mark sat down for
some time beside a glowing campfire. Bill was
resting well, would sleep, they thought,
quietly. The others, too, had retired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark,&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s tone was sober, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
wanted adventure. Most young people
want adventure in one form or another, I
guess. But when it comes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem so wonderful after all,&rdquo;
Mark laughed low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; his sister agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May not be so bad after all,&rdquo; Mark said
cheerfully. &ldquo;While you were taking care of
Bill, we floated three large dry logs out to our
damaged ship. We lashed them to the pontoon
support. That means she won&rsquo;t sink any
more. And when we are frozen in, we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frozen in!&rdquo; Mary was startled. She had
realized in a vague sort of way that at this
very moment the thin ice on the lake was
hardening, that they could not hope to get
away on pontoons, yet the thought of a forced
wait was disturbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how long?&rdquo; she managed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps ten days, perhaps a month. Depends
on the weather.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ten days, a month!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s head swam.
Adventure! Surely this was it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mark,&rdquo; her voice was low with emotion,
&ldquo;so many things might happen. A storm
may come roaring up the mountainside and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wreck the planes beyond repair. Yes,
but we&rsquo;ll do our best and we must trust God
for the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl thought. &ldquo;We must trust
Him and do our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, because she did not wish longer to
dwell upon their own position, she forced her
thoughts into other channels. She tried to
picture the folks at home&mdash;mother, quietly
knitting by the fire, Florence, if she were back
from Palmer, poring over a book, and silent,
occupied only with her thoughts, the strange
Madam Chicaski.</p>
<p>How often she had wished she might read
that woman&rsquo;s thoughts. Did she sometimes
think of the missing copper kettle and the
seven golden candlesticks? If so, what did she
think? What was in her mind as she stood
for a long time staring at the great stump?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get away from here,&rdquo; the girl thought
at last. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back to our snug cabin and
the joys of winter. How peaceful and secure
we shall be. Let the wind roar. We shall be
snug and warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sunday! What a day that will be!
The Petersons with the twins will come over
in a bobsled, and the Dawsons in their home-made
cutter. The Sabins have a dog team.
What sings we shall have!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad you
had to give up training your dogs.&rdquo; Mark had
befriended five shaggy dogs deserted by settlers
gone back to the States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be back to the dogs before you know it.
Besides,&rdquo; Mark laughed a low, merry laugh,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s the cat. What the dogs can&rsquo;t do, the
cat can.&rdquo; (He was speaking of his caterpillar
tractor. They called these &ldquo;cats&rdquo; for short.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mary joined in the laugh. &ldquo;But it
will be truly thrilling to have a dog team.
Wish we had it right now. Then if everything
went wrong we could drive out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but everything won&rsquo;t go wrong.&rdquo;
Mark rose and yawned sleepily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will we see?&rdquo; the girl asked herself as, a
quarter of an hour later, she crept beneath
heavy blankets to lie down upon a bed of
sweet-scented boughs. She knew their plans
in a general sort of way. The gray plane carried
skis. The blue and gray one had none.
Mark and the pilots would work on the disabled
motor of the blue and gray. If they got
it working they would make skis for it. The
two planes would take off on skis as soon as
the ice was safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ticket to adventure,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;When and how will our adventure end? Ah,
well, Mr. McQueen says that so long as our
adventure comes in the line of duty, Providence
will see us through, so surely there is
nothing to fear.&rdquo; With this comforting
thought, she fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />A SECRET IS TOLD</h2>
<p>To Mary the days that followed were
strange beyond belief. The beauty of
mountain sunshine on glistening snow, gray
rocks, and black forests was entrancing. The
sudden up-rushing of a storm, threatening as
it did to destroy their only means of escape,
was terrifying beyond words.</p>
<p>Many and many were the times that she
wished that it might have been Florence who
had been whirled off on this wild adventure
instead of herself. &ldquo;She is so much stronger
than I,&rdquo; she said to Mark. &ldquo;She has seen so
much more of life and seems so much older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had your first-aid lessons in school,&rdquo;
Mark said, a note of encouragement in his
tone. &ldquo;This is one grand opportunity for putting
them into practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Bill agreed, overhearing the conversation.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tough you couldn&rsquo;t kill me
off any way you try.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t try to kill you off, Bill.&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s
tone was all too sober.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Mary,&rdquo; Bill&rsquo;s voice suddenly went
husky. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one grand gal. I don&rsquo;t deserve
half I get, big bum that I am.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say,&rdquo; his voice dropped to a mere
whisper, &ldquo;perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t say it, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t have got it so bad if that fellow Peter
Loome had done his part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done his part?&rdquo; Mary stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Don&rsquo;t you know? He was with me.
Had a powerful 30-40 rifle in his hands. Saw
the bear come after me when I fired and what
did he do but stand right still and laugh!
Roared good and plenty as if it was all being
done in the movies. When I yelled at him he
did limber up and get in a shot or two. I
never did make him out. Something loose in
his make-up, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something sure,&rdquo; Mark agreed solemnly.
Right then and there he wished Loome had
not chanced to be one of the party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of help, that fellow,&rdquo; he added
after a moment&rsquo;s silence. &ldquo;Grumbles about
everything, always demanding that we get
going at once, insists he is losing a chance at
big money by the delay. Then, when we give
him an opportunity to help he bungles everything.
I never saw such a fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big money,&rdquo; Mary thought to herself.
&ldquo;Wonder if that has anything to do with Mr.
Il-ay-ok, the Eskimo, and that far north country?&rdquo;
She was to know.</p>
<p>Daily, under her nursing, Bill improved.
Nightly, but oh, so slowly, the ice on the lake
thickened.</p>
<p>Each day the men labored at the task of
making the planes fit for travel. Mark&rsquo;s genius
for fixing things at last won over the sulky
motor. Once again it purred sweetly or thundered
wildly at man&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Slowly, painstakingly, the men hewed from
solid logs, skis for the smaller plane. Would
these, cut from green wood, as they must be,
stand the strain of taking off? They must wait
and see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>To escape haunting, unnamed fears, Mary
began exploring the mountain ledges. First
she sought out a wild animal trail leading
down, down, down, over tumbled rocks,
through aisles of trees, over the frozen bed
of a narrow stream to a spot where the land
appeared to drop from beneath her. Creeping
out on a flat rock, she gazed in awed silence
down a sheer four hundred feet or more to the
treetops of one more forest. Was the trail she
found, made by wild sheep and goats, safe for
men? She doubted it, yet the time might come
when they must follow that trail or starve.
She returned silent and thoughtful.</p>
<p>That night a storm swept up from the valley.
All night her small tent bulged, flapped
and cracked. All night she shuddered beneath
her blankets, as she listened to the men shouting
to one another down there on the frozen
lake. They were, she knew, battling the storm,
straining at guy ropes to save the planes.</p>
<p>At dawn the wind died away. The temperature
dropped. As she drew her feet from
the blankets she found the air unbelievably
cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freezing fast,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Just what
we want if only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish. Instead, she hurried into
her clothes and then, after racing to a rocky
ledge, found to her consternation that, for a
space of seconds, she did not have the courage
to look down at the lake. That one look would
be the answer to a question that meant great
hope or near despair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>One look at last, then a drop to her knees
as she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God.&rdquo; The planes were safe.</p>
<p>Next instant she was on her feet and racing
to camp ready to serve hot coffee and sourdough
pancakes to the battlers of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo! How gloriously cold!&rdquo; exclaimed the
older of the two pilots. &ldquo;A day and a night
of this and we shall be away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was still some work to be done on the
plane. The storm had strained at every strut
and guy. It was necessary to test all these and
to tighten some. That night, after a hasty
supper, the men made their way back to the
frozen surface of the lake.</p>
<p>With Bill snugly tucked away in the tent
at her back, Mary sat before a glowing fire of
spruce logs. How grand was the night, after
that storm! Not a cloud was in the sky. Not
soon would she forget it, dark spruce trees
towering toward the sky, gray walls of rocks
like grim fortresses of some mythical giant,
the cold, still white of snow and above it all,
a great, golden moon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The North!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Ah, the
North!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, as she thought of it now, they
were not so very far north. She looked up
and away at the north star and wondered
vaguely about Florence&rsquo;s grandfather, Tom
Kennedy, way up there almost beneath that
star. Tom Kennedy was not her grandfather,
he was on the other side of Florence&rsquo;s family,
yet, so intimate had the relations between
herself and her big cousin become, she felt a
sudden, burning desire to accompany her on
her quest for her grandfather, if indeed the
quest was ever begun.</p>
<p>Had she but known it, Florence was at that
very moment in Anchorage making inquiries
regarding transportation to Nome. Only a
few days before, Mark, having received his last
payment for the summer&rsquo;s crop, had pressed
a crisp new fifty-dollar bill into her reluctant
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You earned it and much more,&rdquo; had been
his husky reply to her protest. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been
a regular farm hand and&mdash;and a brick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Fifty dollars! What could one not do with
that? It seemed now that nothing much could
be done. Had there been a boat, it might have
been possible to secure steerage passage.
There was no boat, ice had closed sea transportation
for nine long months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your only chance is the air-mail plane,&rdquo;
a kindly storekeeper assured her, &ldquo;and air
travel costs money in the north. Nothing like
what it was in the days of dog-team travel,
but plenty. Fifty dollars? Why, Miss, that
wouldn&rsquo;t buy oil for the trip. Better wait for
spring. Then you can go by boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wait until spring? Nine months? Spring?
That was time for work on the little valley
farm. &ldquo;Winter is the time for adventure,&rdquo; she
recalled the young aviator&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage it some way. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to,&rdquo;
she turned suddenly away.</p>
<p>Meantime, in her mountain fastness, Mary
was thinking of the long-lost grandfather and
wondering vaguely about Mr. Il-ay-ok, the
Eskimo, when, catching a slight sound, she
looked up to see Peter Loome sitting beside
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>This sudden discovery was startling. By the
light of the fire this man&rsquo;s face was more repulsive
than by day. She wondered, with a
touch of panic, why he was here. Then, reassured
by the nearness of Bill in the tent and
of her friends below on the lake, she settled
back in her place.</p>
<p>For a long time they sat there in silence
with the eyes of night, the stars, looking down
upon them. Then, because she could endure
the silence no longer, and because she truly
wanted to know, Mary said, &ldquo;Mr. Loome, why
do you hate that little Eskimo who calls himself
Mr. Il-ay-ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I,&rdquo; the man started, &ldquo;I&mdash;well, you
see, he&rsquo;s in my way, er&mdash;that is, he wants to
be. He won&rsquo;t be long. I&mdash;&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s voice
rose, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll smash him!&rdquo; His foot crashed down
upon the rocks. &ldquo;Like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s voice was low.</p>
<p>For some time there came no answer. In
the sky a star began sliding. It cut a circle
and disappeared in the dark blue of night. A
streak of light reached for the milky way.
Northern lights, the girl thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Suddenly the man spoke. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo;
you. You&rsquo;ll never be up there,&rdquo; he pointed
toward the north. &ldquo;None of you dirt-diggers
down here will ever be up there where the
north begins, where men and dogs fight fer
what they git an&rsquo; ask neither odds ner quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary caught her breath as he paused. He is
sort of a rough poet she thought. At that
moment she almost admired him. But not for
long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the reindeer,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;Eskimo&rsquo;s
got &rsquo;em. Too many of &rsquo;em. What does an
Eskimo know about makin&rsquo; money? Nothin&rsquo;!
Then what&rsquo;s the good of him havin&rsquo; all them
reindeer? No good!&rdquo; He spat on the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at last the Government is seein&rsquo; reason,&rdquo;
he went on after a time. &ldquo;The Government&rsquo;s
told the Eskimo they gotta take their
reindeer back&mdash;back&mdash;back, way back to the
mountains where there&rsquo;s plenty of feed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think the Eskimos&rsquo;ll do it?&rdquo; He squinted
his eyes at her. &ldquo;Narry a one. They&rsquo;ll stick
to the shore. They&rsquo;ll hunt seal an&rsquo; walrus, or
starve. That&rsquo;s where their homes is, on the

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; his voice dropped. &ldquo;So they&rsquo;ll sell
their reindeer, sell &rsquo;em cheap. And who&rsquo;ll buy?
Me! Me and my company. We got money.
We&rsquo;ll get rich on reindeer. Reindeer!&rdquo; Leaping
to his feet, he started pacing like some
wild beast before the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Il-ay-ok,&rdquo; he went on after a time.
&ldquo;He thinks he can stop us. He&rsquo;s educated.
Think of it! Educated! An Eskimo educated!&rdquo;
he laughed hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed such a nice, polite little man,&rdquo;
Mary ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe he is. Polite!&rdquo; one more burst
of laughter. &ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t get nowhere with
politeness. He&rsquo;s outside now, down in Washington.
The last boat&rsquo;s come from up yonder.
No more for nine months. Reindeer got to get
into the mountains before this old year dies.
What can this polite Il-ay-ok do about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are airplanes,&rdquo; Mary suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Like them down there!&rdquo; the man exploded.
&ldquo;I wish to&mdash;they&rsquo;d get the things
going. He might escape me, your polite,
greasy little Es-ki-mo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear little Es-ki-mo,&rsquo;&rdquo; he chanted hoarsely,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Leave all your ice and snow. Come play
with me.&rsquo; I used to sing that in school. Can
you e-mag-ine!&rdquo; His laugh rose louder than
before. Then, of a sudden, it faded. Footsteps
were heard approaching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mark said cheerfully. &ldquo;Everything
is O. K. We&rsquo;ll be out of here in twenty-four
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! That-a-boy!&rdquo; Peter Loome patted
him on the back.</p>
<p>As for Mary, she suddenly found herself
wishing that their stay here might be prolonged,
she was thinking of the polite little
man who called himself &ldquo;Mr. Il-ay-ok.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />HELP FROM THE SKY</h2>
<p>True to Mark&rsquo;s prophecy, dawn of the
following day found them on the move.
By the light of a candle, hotcakes and coffee
had been stowed away under their belts. Now
they were ready to pack up.</p>
<p>As Mary stepped from the tent her eyes fell
upon a pair of lifeless eyes that seemed to stare
down upon her. One of the hunters had killed
a moose. All this time, well out of the reach
of thieving wild creatures, its head had hung
there in a tree. It seemed now a little strange
that those dead eyes could give her such a
start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she whispered, stamping her
foot. &ldquo;Enough to dread without that.&rdquo; And
indeed there was. Despite the fact that the
men agreed on the solidness of the ice, she
dreaded the take-off. What if the ice were
thinner in some places than at others? What
if it should give way at just the wrong time?
What of the planes? Were they truly fit for
service? And what of those hand-made skis?
All these fears were banished by the excitement
of breaking camp. Tents were taken
down, bedding was made into bundles, and
bags were packed. Bill, now quite able to
walk, but with arms still smothered in bandages,
was helped down the trail.</p>
<p>Mary thrilled anew as she approached the
small blue and gray plane. &ldquo;A ticket to adventure,&rdquo;
she whispered for the hundredth
time. Then her face sobered. Was this to be
the end of adventure or only its beginning?
An hour&rsquo;s safe flying would bring them to
the cabin where there awaited dishes to wash,
beds to make, paths to shovel, all the daily
round. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she told herself with renewed
interest, &ldquo;yes, and Madam Chicaski to wonder
about. Where adventure ends, mystery begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing pleased her, she was to travel
with Bill and Mark in the smaller plane. She
liked being with her friends. She was very
fond of Speed Samson, the smiling young
pilot. She feared and hated Peter Loome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am taking the hunters straight to Anchorage.
They seem to be in one grand rush,&rdquo;
Dave Breen, pilot of the large gray plane, said.
Then aside to Mary he whispered, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
paying me well. Hunt me up in Anchorage
and I&rsquo;ll buy you a hot fudge sundae.&rdquo; Mary
smiled her thanks. They were fine fellows,
these pilots, just how fine she was later to
learn.</p>
<p>The take-off was exciting. She shuddered
as they glided over the ice. An ominous crack-crack-crack
sent chills up her spine, yet the
ice held. There had been a light snowfall.
The snow was sticky, it would not let them
go. Round and round the lake they whirled.
Louder and louder the motors thundered.
Then someone shouted &ldquo;Up!&rdquo; and up they
went whirling away over the treetops.</p>
<p>Once again the glorious panorama of dark
forest, gray crags, winding streams and blankets
of snow lay beneath them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going home! Home!&rdquo; Mary shouted
in Mark&rsquo;s ear. Mark nodded soberly. He
was listening. Listening for what? Mary
knew well enough, for trouble, motor trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no trouble,&rdquo; she assured herself.
Once again she thought of home. What
a place of joy that once deserted valley of the
North had become for them. She thought of
the worried millions in the cities and scattered
over the plain far to the south of them&mdash;worried
millions wondering where the next week&rsquo;s
food supply was to come from. She thought of
their well-lined cupboards, of their cellar
bursting with good things to eat, then sighed
a sigh of content.</p>
<p>This mood was short-lived. Even she caught
and understood the strange shudders that
shook the small plane. A moment of this and
they went circling downward toward the shining
white surface of a small lake. Once again
her heart was in her mouth. They had left the
higher altitudes where the nights were bitter
cold. They were equipped with skis. Would
this new lake be frozen hard enough for that?
Scarcely time for these few flashing thoughts
and bump&mdash;they hit the lake. Bump&mdash;bump&mdash;bump.
What glorious bumps those were.
They meant one more happy landing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Dismounting, the girl stared aloft while the
large gray plane circled over them. Once,
twice, three times it circled through the blue,
then, with a sudden burst of speed, like some
wild duck that had heard the bang of a hunter&rsquo;s
gun, it sped straight away.</p>
<p class="tb">Florence was walking disconsolately back
and forth along the pier at Anchorage early
that same afternoon. She was deep in her own
thoughts. Having gone for a visit to Palmer,
she had been invited to come for a stay at
Anchorage. Sending a note back to her cousins,
she had taken the train for Anchorage.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Mary had met high adventure,
while she was meeting with bitter
disappointment. She had so hoped that her
lone fifty-dollar bill would somehow carry her
to that charmed city of her grandfather,
Nome, Alaska.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance!&rdquo; she murmured low. &ldquo;Not a
chance in the world.&rdquo; And yet, she dared hope.</p>
<p>Now catching the drone of an airplane motor,
she shaded her eyes to look away toward
the east. Standing where she was, she watched
the large gray plane come driving in, then circling
low, make a perfect landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;If only&mdash;&rdquo; she did
not finish, but marched soberly on her way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Having made a round of the city&rsquo;s stores,
she was headed back to the home of her hostess.
&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I shall go
back to our happy valley.&rdquo; But would it be
so happy for her? When one longs to be in
one place, can he be truly happy in another?
Who knows? As it turned out, Florence would
not be obliged to test her ability to be happy.</p>
<p>Of a sudden, as she walked along, she heard
someone call: &ldquo;Florence! Florence Huyler!&rdquo;
Turning about, she found herself facing a total
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Florence Huyler,&rdquo; the man smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how did you know?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t been, you wouldn&rsquo;t have
turned about so quickly,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Ever
try calling out quite loudly, &lsquo;John!&rsquo; at the edge
of a large crowd? No, of course not. Just try
it sometime. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at the number
of Johns that turn to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&mdash;&rdquo; his voice changed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not
the point. Suppose you heard of the accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accident? No! I&mdash;&rdquo; her face paled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now! nothing to be excited about,&rdquo;
he warned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been away from home
so you haven&rsquo;t heard. Your friend Bill got
clawed up a bit by a bear. Say!&rdquo; his voice
rose. &ldquo;Want to come in here and sit on a stool
while I tell you? I&rsquo;m dying for a cup of coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al&mdash;all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later, their feet dangling
from stools, they were drinking coffee, munching
doughnuts, and talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; the aviator ended his story,
&ldquo;your cousin did me a mighty fine turn. I got
a good fee for bringing those hunters out and
so if you or he ever need a lift, just signal me
by Morse code or any other way and I&rsquo;ll turn
my motor over P.D.Q.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to Nome
tomorrow, but I&rsquo;ll be back. Back before you
know it. Not such a long trip that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
The girl&rsquo;s face had turned purple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choked! Well, I&rsquo;ll be! Here, let me&mdash;&rdquo;
He began pounding her on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just&mdash;just a&mdash;a&mdash;piece of dough&mdash;doughnut,&rdquo;
she managed to sputter at last. &ldquo;Went&mdash;dow&mdash;down
the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you get that way often?&rdquo; he grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only when people tell me they&rsquo;re going to
Nome.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so awful about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awful? It&rsquo;s glorious. If only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I were going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fishing in her pocket, she displayed her
only banknote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good money,&rdquo; the pilot felt of it
with thumb and finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not enough,&rdquo; she shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trip to Nome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Nome! You want to go to Nome?
You&rsquo;re off, child! You&rsquo;re off right now.
There&rsquo;s just room for one more. Got the Bowmans
to take up, three of &rsquo;em. Big reindeer
people. Grand folks! Just room for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tha&mdash;&rdquo; Florence could not finish. She had
choked again, but not on a doughnut. Mutely
she held out the crumpled bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it in your pocket, child,&rdquo; his tone was
gruff but kind, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need it. But say! Why
do you want to go to Nome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a grandfather up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And haven&rsquo;t seen him for a long time,&rdquo; he
added for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Never saw your grandfather? Say!
That&rsquo;s terrible. I had two of &rsquo;em. Grand old
sports. Both gone now. Say! That&rsquo;s great!
And you&rsquo;re going with me to hunt up your
grandfather. That, why that&rsquo;s like moving
pictures. Going? Of course you&rsquo;re going!
Due to take off at nine a. m.&rdquo; He slid off the
stool, then held out a hand. &ldquo;Glad to have met
you. Meet you again right here at 8:30 tomorrow
morning. Will you be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would she? If necessary she would form a
one-man line and stand right here in the snow
and cold until the sun rose and the clock said
a half hour after eight.</p>

<br />IN SEARCH OF A GRANDFATHER</h2>
<p>Nothing very serious had happened to
the blue and gray plane that was carrying
Mary and her friends toward their home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A loose wire connection, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; the
pilot explained as he read the worry wrinkles
on the girl&rsquo;s brow. &ldquo;Have it fixed before you
know it. And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; Mary breathed. How she loved
that word. Would she ever want to leave that
home again?</p>
<p>A half hour later they were once again in
the air. One more half hour and their skis
touched the frozen surface of their own small
lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome home,&rdquo; Dave shouted as he came
racing toward them. &ldquo;Just in time for a feast.
Tim Barber got a deer yesterday. We&rsquo;re having
a roast of it for dinner, your mother and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Madam Chicaski?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure!&rdquo; Dave laughed. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t
drive her away. And who&rsquo;d want to? She&rsquo;s
been a splendid help to your mother, milked
the cow, fed the horse, hauled wood, everything.
And now,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s
fixing to run a trap-line. From somewhere
she&rsquo;s dug out a lot of rusty traps and is shining
them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she&mdash;&rdquo; Mary hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revealed her secrets&mdash;copper kettle, golden
candlesticks, all that? Not a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mary,&rdquo; Dave took both her hands.
&ldquo;How good it is to see you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad to be back, David,&rdquo; Mary
blushed in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about me?&rdquo; Bill demanded in a
bantering tone. &ldquo;You should be glad I&rsquo;m
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are, Bill,&rdquo; Mrs. Hughes said with a
friendly smile. &ldquo;Awfully glad to have you
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll not have me long. Boo!&rdquo; Bill
shuddered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off with the wild birds for a
warmer climate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be back, Bill,&rdquo; the elder McQueen
rumbled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a pioneer for a summer.
After that you may not want to be a
pioneer, but you&rsquo;ll be one all the same. The
snow-peaked mountains, the timber that turns
to green in spring and gold in autumn, the
lure of gold, the call of the wild will bring
you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that.&rdquo; For once Bill&rsquo;s
face took on a sober look.</p>
<p>Turning about, Mrs. Hughes led them all,
like a brood of chicks, to the cabin where the
delicious odor of roast venison greeted their
nostrils. Over that venison, now turning it,
now testing, and now turning again, large,
silent, mysterious, hovered Madam Chicaski.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to Nome by plane?&rdquo; the
eyes of Mrs. Maver, Florence&rsquo;s gray-haired
hostess at Anchorage, shone. &ldquo;Going with the
Bowmans? Why, that&rsquo;s splendid. They are old
friends of ours. We knew them before they
went to Nome. I must have them over to
dinner.&rdquo; And she did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going north with us?&rdquo; Mrs.
Bowman, a round, jolly person, beamed on
Florence as they entered the small parlor to
await the announcement of dinner. &ldquo;Never
been there before, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll enjoy it. Why, you&rsquo;re just the sort
of girl for that country. Healthy! Look at her
cheeks, John,&rdquo; Mrs. Bowman turned to her
husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a grand prospector,&rdquo; Mr. Bowman,
a large, ruddy-faced man, laughed. &ldquo;Going
after gold, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I might,&rdquo; Florence admitted timidly.
&ldquo;But first I must find my grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grandfather?&rdquo; Mrs. Bowman stared
at her. &ldquo;Is he in Nome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, John!&rdquo; Mrs. Bowman broke in excitedly.
&ldquo;This is Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s granddaughter.
She, why, she&rsquo;s the living image of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, my dear,&rdquo; the husband admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! And do I truly look like him?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s
mind went into a wild whirl. &ldquo;I am his
granddaughter, but who&rsquo;d have thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we could tell it? That is strange. But
such things do happen. Shall we be seated?&rdquo;
Mrs. Bowman took a chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you,&rdquo; she leaned forward, &ldquo;your
grandfather is a wonderful man, truly remarkable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he is?&rdquo; Florence stared. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he was just an old sourdough prospector,&rdquo;
Mr. Bowman put in. &ldquo;Not a bit of it.
He is a prospector, has been for thirty-five
years. Found gold once and lost it again to
save his partner&rsquo;s life. Yes, a prospector, but
a long beard, hair to the shoulders, beer guzzler
always dreaming about the past? Not a
bit of it! Tom Kennedy is young, young as a
boy. Keen as any youngster, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And clean,&rdquo; Mrs. Bowman put in. &ldquo;Never
drinks a drop. I don&rsquo;t think he even smokes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; her voice dropped to conversational
tone, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s doing a truly wonderful
thing. He&rsquo;s got the notion that our young
people are growing soft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, too,&rdquo; Mr. Bowman grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s trying to bring back some
of our glorious past, dog-teams, long, moonlit
trails, the search for gold. He&rsquo;s trying to interest
the young people in all that,&rdquo; added
Mrs. Bowman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing it, too,&rdquo; Bowman nodded his
head. &ldquo;Look at the dog race. They really
think they&rsquo;ll win,&rdquo; he laughed good-naturedly.
&ldquo;Of course they won&rsquo;t. Smitty Valentine&rsquo;s
going to beat &rsquo;em, by an hour or two. Good
thing to have them try, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Mrs. Bowman explained, &ldquo;we
have an annual dog race. It ends with a big
feast in honor of the winner. Your grandfather
has gotten the young people interested
in that race, made them think they can win.
They&rsquo;ve put their best dogs together into a
team. A boy named Jodie Joleson is going to
drive it. I surely wish they could win. But
this man, Smitty Valentine, who is backed by
all the pool halls and men&rsquo;s clubs in town, has
won so many years hand running, that we&rsquo;ve
lost track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belongs to the Sourdough Club,&rdquo; Bowman
explained. &ldquo;Sort of old timers&rsquo; club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now these young people have what
they call the &lsquo;Fresh Dough Club&rsquo; of young
timers,&rdquo; Mrs. Bowman laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I think you may all come in and
sit down at the table.&rdquo; It was their hostess
who brought to an end this&mdash;to Florence&mdash;amazing
revelation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that is what he&rsquo;s like,&rdquo; she whispered
to herself. &ldquo;How strange! How wonderful!
And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a sober Florence who, after sending
word to her cousins regarding this, her proposed
journey, climbed aboard the large gray
monoplane. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; she was thinking, &ldquo;is to
be my most exciting adventure. I wonder how
it will end?&rdquo; How indeed? Seldom does a
girl go in search of her grandfather. And how
her ideas of that grandfather had changed!
She had always known, in a sketchy manner,
the story of her grandfather&rsquo;s life. A big,
boisterous, fun-loving youth, little more than
a boy, he had loved and married a beautiful,
frail girl from a proud well-to-do family. That
girl became Florence&rsquo;s grandmother.</p>
<p>Tom Kennedy was not loved by his wife&rsquo;s
parents. They made life hard for him. When
at last life under his own roof became unbearable,
he had found escape by joining the gold
rush to Alaska.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Alaska brought more hardships, cold, hunger,
and disappointment. And after that,
months on the way, a letter reached him, saying
that his wife was dead and that, without
his consent, her parents had adopted his only
child, a girl. That girl had been Florence&rsquo;s
mother.</p>
<p>From that day, Tom Kennedy was lost to
the outside world. &ldquo;But Alaska,&rdquo; Florence
thought, with a tightening at the throat,
&ldquo;Alaska, it would seem, came to know and
love him. And now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes&mdash;and now. She had always thought
of Tom Kennedy as a typical prospector, like
Malcomb Dale, who had lured Bill from his
ranch. And now here he was, not rich, but
loved and respected. She was going to him.
The large gray plane, drumming steadily onward,
carried her over broad stretches of
timber, frozen lakes, arms of the sea, on and
on and on, toward Tom Kennedy, her grandfather.
And how would he receive her?</p>
<p>The answer to this question came when,
four days later, a little breathless, but quite
determined, she stood at the door of a weather-beaten
cabin, on the outskirts of Nome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; a large, hearty voice roared.</p>
<p>It was with uncertain movements that she
lifted the iron latch, pushed the door open
and stepped inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, Miss.&rdquo; A tall man,
with keen gray eyes that matched his well-trimmed
beard, rose hastily to his feet. &ldquo;I
thought it was one of the boys. And it&rsquo;s you,
a stranger and a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a stranger,&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s voice was low
with emotion. &ldquo;I&mdash;I am Florence Huyler, your
granddaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effect on the old man was strange.
Taking a step backward, he drew a hand
across his face, then spoke as in a dream:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My granddaughter? No! It cannot be.
And yet, it could be so. I had a wife. She was
beautiful.... I loved her.... She died....
All this was long ago. I could not go back.
The call of gold got me, and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are my granddaughter,&rdquo; his voice
changed. The notion seemed unreal but pleasing
to him. &ldquo;My granddaughter! How
strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; Florence tried to smile, &ldquo;that
we look alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; Tom Kennedy looked at her
long and earnestly. &ldquo;Big for a girl,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;You look strong as a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Florence admitted frankly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>At that, Tom Kennedy looked at himself in
a glass by the window. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; his eyes brightened,
&ldquo;yes, we do look alike. Welcome, child!
Welcome to your grandfather&rsquo;s cabin.&rdquo; Seizing
her hand, he held it for a moment with a
grip that hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more member for that gang of young
pirates that haunt this cabin of mine,&rdquo; he
laughed. &ldquo;You must meet them all, meet them
and get to know them. They&rsquo;re a fine lot, my
gang. First thing I know you&rsquo;ll be their
leader, I&rsquo;m bound. You&rsquo;re a Kennedy and
that means a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence replied with a smile, &ldquo;I
am sure it means a very great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was that Florence found her
grandfather, and at once a whole new wonderful
life opened up for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />THE FRESH-DOUGH CLUB</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Such a delicious odor!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.
With the prompt reactions of
buoyant youth, she made herself at home in
her grandfather&rsquo;s cabin. Now, being hungry,
she began sniffing the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mulligan stew,&rdquo; the old man explained.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done to a turn. Never a better one made.
Prime young reindeer meat, bacon, evaporated
potatoes, fresh onions, a spoonful of dried
eggs, a pound of red beans, pepper, salt, fresh
seal oil. Guess that&rsquo;s about all there is in it.
Hungry?&rdquo; he smiled down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always hungry,&rdquo; Florence smiled.</p>
<p>Taking a huge bowl from the cupboard in
the corner, Tom Kennedy filled it to the brim.
Into an equally huge cup was poured steaming
black coffee. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re healthy up here,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;We can take it straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So can I,&rdquo; Florence gulped down a burning
draught.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Um&mdash;um,&rdquo; she breathed a moment later
as she tasted the stew. &ldquo;I can cook a little, but
not like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It comes,&rdquo; said the old man, his words
slow and melodious, &ldquo;comes with time. I&rsquo;ve
been in the North thirty-five years.&rdquo; The expression
on his face changed. His thoughts,
Florence told herself, must be far away.</p>
<p>She tried to read those thoughts, to discover
whether they had to do with his boyhood
days and his frail, child-wife who had
died long ago, or with gray mountains,
long trails, whirling snow and the lost mine.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were suddenly broken in upon
by a breezy figure who appeared to have been
blown through the door by a gust of wind.</p>
<p>A ruddy-faced youth, he was, garbed in a
blue drill parka that looked like a slip-over
dress, corduroy trousers and sealskin boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Pop!&rdquo; he exclaimed, not seeing the
girl. &ldquo;Great stuff today. Did fifty miles an&rsquo;
cut twenty minutes off the time. I&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you! Stay out!&rdquo; he shouted suddenly
as a half dozen great gray-brown beasts came
tumbling into the room. They struck the
young man with such force that he was suddenly
thrown into the corner where Florence
sat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg pardon,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jodie, meet my granddaughter, Florence
Huyler.&rdquo; Wrinkles of amusement appeared
about Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your&mdash;your granddaughter!&rdquo; the young
man&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;Why, Pop, we
didn&rsquo;t know you had a living relative!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I, son. Not until just now.
She dropped down from the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jodie, here,&rdquo; Tom Kennedy turned to Florence,
&ldquo;is the uncrowned king of Alaskan dog-mushers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jodie drawled, &ldquo;crown&rsquo;s likely to
get a trifle tarnished before I get to wear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jodie Joleson,&rdquo; there was a ring of enthusiasm
in the girl&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchorage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Way down there! How fame does travel,&rdquo;
he replied in mock seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Grandfather,&rdquo; Florence faced
about. &ldquo;Did a girl ever win your dog race?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What? A girl?&rdquo; the old man stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Jodie answered for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so certain?&rdquo; Florence gave the young
man a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see&mdash;see,&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
long race, hundred miles and back. How could
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was just wondering. You see, I&rsquo;m
new to the country,&rdquo; Florence half apologized.
There remained in her eyes, quite unobserved
by her companions, a peculiar gleam that
might mean almost anything.</p>
<p>The days that followed were the strangest,
most thrilling of Florence Huyler&rsquo;s young life.
Because she was Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s granddaughter,
she was taken at once into the very heart
of the young set of Nome. A bright, jolly,
carefree, healthy crowd she found them to be.
She might, had she so chosen, have risen at
once to a place of leadership among them. She
did not choose. A natural, friendly girl, she
loved being a member of some jolly gang, but
being their leader, ah! that was quite another
matter. She was not ambitious in this way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>She might, had she wished it, have been
wined and dined from morning to night, for,
of all the sociable, good-time-loving people,
the dwellers of Alaska belong at the top. This
she did not choose. From time to time she
joined in some quiet evening affair. For the
most part, two subjects held the center of her
every waking thought, her grandfather and
the coming annual dog race.</p>
<p>On stormy days she enjoyed lying stretched
out on a couch before the glowing fire, while
Tom Kennedy in his low, musical voice that
rumbled like a drum, told of his days on
Arctic trails. Always and always she listened
for the story that would, she knew, hold her
spellbound, the story of his lost mine. Day
after day passed and he made no mention of
it. More than once she bit her lips to keep
from suggesting it. Always her question remained
unasked. She could wait.</p>
<p>On bright days she might have been seen
trotting along after Jodie Joleson&rsquo;s dog sled.
At first the boy appeared to resent that. She
could almost hear him say, &ldquo;A girl! Sooner
or later she&rsquo;ll go too far, play out, then I&rsquo;ll
have to haul her home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his vast astonishment and final utter admiration,
he found that she did not tire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Florence, as you will know if you have read
about her, was far from a weakling. From a
small child she had gloried in strength and
health. No slender waist line acquired on a
diet of pickles and nut sundaes for her. She
gloried in all of life, good things to eat, long
nights of sleep, and now, most of all, long,
long trails.</p>
<p>One day, when a storm was coming in from
the northwest, Jodie deliberately took the trail
that leads up the coast, then over the bitter
wind-blown flats of Tissue River.</p>
<p>By the time they reached those flats, the
whole narrow valley was a mad whirl of snow.
Without a word to the girl, Jodie headed his
dogs straight into the storm and shouted one
word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Magnificent beasts that they were, they
sprang into the harness. Their speed redoubled,
they leaped forward.</p>
<p>Plop-plop-plop, went Jodie&rsquo;s skin boots on
the hard-packed snow. Fainter, yet unmistakable,
came the girl&rsquo;s trotting footsteps behind
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>The storm grew wilder. The team, striking
a stretch of glare-ice, was blown straight
across it to pile up in a heap on the other side.
Without a word Jodie disentangled them.
Then, turning to the girl, he said, &ldquo;Cheek&rsquo;s
froze. Take off your mitten and thaw it out
with your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Florence smiled as best she
could. &ldquo;Yours too are frozen. If you don&rsquo;t
mind, I&rsquo;ll do yours first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hand went hastily to his cheek, then
he chuckled, &ldquo;O. K. You win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes more and they were again battling
the storm.</p>
<p>For two full hours, with the wind tearing
at their parkas and the frost biting their
cheeks, they battled onward. Then, of a sudden,
the dogs took a sharp turn, climbed a
ridge, dropped down into a valley, and they
were out of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re a better man than I am, Gungadin!&rdquo;
Jodie panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think I&rsquo;m good?&rdquo; there was
a note of suppressed eagerness in the girl&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you are!&rdquo; the boy exclaimed. &ldquo;Of
course you are. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I was just thinking,&rdquo; she evaded. &ldquo;You&mdash;you
know, everybody wants to be good at
things,&rdquo; she added rather lamely. &ldquo;But look!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;your face is frozen again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is yours. My turn for thawing out.&rdquo;
His mitten was off, his warm hand on her
cheek.</p>
<p>And thus Florence won Jodie&rsquo;s complete
approval.</p>
<p>That night the girl learned the joyous comfort
of a long-haired deer skin sleeping-bag
in a road house bunk. She slept the sleep of
the just while the storm roared on.</p>
<p>Next day, with the wind down and the sun
creeping low above the jagged outline of
snow-topped mountains, they journeyed slowly
homeward, Florence, Jodie, and the racing
team.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />HER GREAT DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>Of all the girls in the Fresh-Dough Club,
Florence liked Alene Bowman best.
Alene was quiet and, for a girl of the North,
very modest. She was greatly interested in
the social events of the season and especially
in the annual dog race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;d like to ask you,&rdquo;
Florence said to her, the day after her return
from that trip up the coast. &ldquo;What do you
think would happen if a girl entered the race?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Alene stared for a space of ten
seconds. &ldquo;Why, nothing, I guess. This is the
North, you know. You thinking of going in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; Florence spoke slowly. &ldquo;Of course,
I wouldn&rsquo;t go in against Jodie, unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you felt sure he couldn&rsquo;t win and
that perhaps you could,&rdquo; Alene suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s just it!&rdquo; the large girl exclaimed.
&ldquo;It means a great deal to you young
folks, that race.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A terrible lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I should go in and win&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be the girl of the hour. Then, why,
we&rsquo;d ride you in triumph on our shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, broad shoulders,&rdquo; Florence smiled.
&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t think of me as an outsider?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. Anyone related to Pop Kennedy
just couldn&rsquo;t be an outsider. Besides,
you&rsquo;re a member of the club, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks&mdash;I&mdash;I just sort of wanted to know.
I&rsquo;ll be going.&rdquo; Florence turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Wait. There&rsquo;s something father told
me last night. You pass it on to Jodie if I
don&rsquo;t see him first. Tell him to keep a good
watch on his dogs. There are things they do,
you know, dope them or something, that slows
them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that old-timer rival of his, Smitty,
wouldn&rsquo;t do that?&rdquo; Florence was shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not Smitty. He&rsquo;s a real sport. Win
fair or not at all. So are the others going in,
Scot Jordan and Sinrock Charlie. They&rsquo;ll play
fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are some foreigners, quite a lot of
them, all through the North, Syrians, Russians,
and Japs. They are gamblers by trade.
They&rsquo;re getting up books on the race. They&rsquo;re
gambling heavily on Smitty to win. And
father says there&rsquo;s nothing they won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll tell Jodie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Florence thought, as she made her
way home, &ldquo;is all the more reason why we
should have another team in the field. But
where is it to come from?&rdquo; Where indeed?
In these days when both passengers and
freight are carried by airplanes, really fine dog
teams are becoming all too rare in the North.
This Florence had learned from Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s
own lips.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, as if an answer to a
prayer, in the van of a storm, the very team
blew into town that same afternoon. Florence
first saw them as they came tumbling over a
high snow bank at the outskirts of the city.
The sled as well as its driver piled up with the
dogs. When Florence had helped them to
right themselves, she found herself staring in
admiration at a beautiful Eskimo girl, garbed
in a handsome fawn skin parka, and at the
grandest team of gray Siberian wolfhounds
she had ever seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your dogs?&rdquo; she managed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;me,&rdquo; the girl showed all her fine teeth
in a smile. &ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s dogs. Il-ay-ok my
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Mr. Il-ay-ok is your brother?&rdquo;
Like a flash Florence saw the little man
dressed in white man&rsquo;s clothes on the dock
at Anchorage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Il-ay-ok my brother,&rdquo; the girl nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these are his dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Sure! Sure! His dogs. You wan-to
ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Florence had found what she wanted
she was a fast worker. This girl At-a-tak, she
learned, had driven in from Cape Prince of
Wales. She would stay in Nome with friends
until her brother returned by airplane from
his journey. Yes, she would be pleased to loan
her brother&rsquo;s dog team to the big white girl
until they were needed. How long would that
be? She did not know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Florence had learned from her friends at
Nome that Il-ay-ok had gone on an important
commission in the interest of his people. She
knew, too, that it had to do with reindeer. The
Bowmans had told her this much. They had
assured her also that, though they were large
herders of reindeer, they were entirely in sympathy
with Il-ay-ok and his purposes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men who are trying to edge in on
the reindeer business,&rdquo; Mr. Bowman had said
with a gesture of disgust, &ldquo;are rank outsiders.
They know nothing of native problems and
care less. They will rob the people of their
last reindeer if they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing all this, Florence, whose sympathy
went out freely to all simple, kindly people,
wished Mr. Il-ay-ok a successful conclusion
of his mission and a speedy journey home.
For all that, she could not help hoping that
he might not arrive until after the race was
over, for now, with this wonderful team at
her command, she was resolved to spend many
hours each day on the trail and, if occasion
seemed to warrant it, to venture in where no
girl had dared venture before.</p>
<p>Two hours later she was again at Alene
Bowman&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell a soul!&rdquo; she implored,
after she had told how she had come
into possession of the gray team. &ldquo;Not a single
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single soul,&rdquo; Alene echoed. &ldquo;Cross
my heart and hope to die.&rdquo; And Alene could
keep a secret.</p>
<p>Every day after that Florence, behind her
superb team, went for a &ldquo;ride.&rdquo; Each time she
purposely drove through a well-populated section
of the city. Always she wore a heavy
deer skin parka and remained as far as eyes
could see her seated on her sled with her team
trotting along at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>All was changed when at last a hill had
hidden her from view. Leaping from her sled,
she threw off the heavy parka, drew on a thin
calico one and a squirrel skin cap and, seizing
the handles of the sled, screamed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mush! You mush!&rdquo; This shout acted on
the dog team like an electric shock. They
shot away with the speed of the wind.</p>
<p>They were wise, were these dogs. Not four
days had passed when her shout was no longer
needed. Once the last house had disappeared
from sight, Gray Chief, her dog leader, began
cocking his ears. The instant her costume
change was complete, without a word from
the young driver, he was away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win,&rdquo; she hissed more than once
through tight-shut teeth. &ldquo;Win it we must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At times she found Jodie looking at her in
a strange way. Did he suspect her purpose?
Did he imagine she would enter the race
against him if his chances were good? She
was very fond of Jodie. Not for all the world
would she offend him. But she would not tell
him of her plans, at least not for the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; she said once when the two
were alone, &ldquo;is there a time limit for entering
the race?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entries must be in at noon of the day before
the race,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; the word escaped unbidden from
her lips. He gave her a strange look, but said
never a word.</p>
<p>That same day he told her the story of his
lost mine, told how he and his partner had
worked their way back, back, back into the
mountains, how, having found traces of gold,
they had built a cabin and how they had
worked day after day until the strike came,
when they found nuggets as large as marbles,
a very few nuggets but promise of many more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That very night,&rdquo; his voice dropped, &ldquo;Joe
was taken sick. It was serious. I made a sled
and hauled him out. That was a battle. I
froze, starved, and fought my way and,&rdquo; his
voice dropped, &ldquo;and lost. Partner died. Never
found the mine again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps someone else found it,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; there was a suggestion of mystery
in his voice. &ldquo;We hid it. Joe and I hid that
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that day, more than ever before, the
girl wanted to go in search of that mine. Go
where? Ah! that was the question.</p>
<p>The answer came two days later and in a
rather strange manner. A young scientist, a
member of the Geological Survey, showed her
a series of enlarged photographs taken from
the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cover hundreds of square miles back
there in the great unknown,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;See! Rivers, lakes, tundra, mountains, everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything!&rdquo; the girl had been struck with
an idea. &ldquo;Loan them to me for an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; the young man agreed. &ldquo;Two
hours if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Fifteen minutes later she tore into Tom
Kennedy&rsquo;s cabin acting like a mad person.
Pushing a table into the kitchen, throwing
chairs on the bed in the small back room, she
at last cleared the living room floor. Then,
while her grandfather stared she thumb-tacked
sheet after sheet of paper to the floor until
there was no longer room to stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;There it all is, mountains,
lakes, rivers, tundra, everything. Here
is Nome,&rdquo; she pointed. &ldquo;There is Sawtooth
Mountain. Now, where was your mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full quarter hour, as the tin clock in
the corner ticked the minutes away, the gray-haired
prospector&rsquo;s eyes moved back and forth
across that map, then, with a sudden gasp,
he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is! Right there. Well up on the
middle fork of that river. I&rsquo;d swear to it if
it was the last word I ever said. Girl, you&rsquo;re a
wonder!&rdquo; Suddenly he threw his long arms
about her and kissed her on the cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon as that race is over we&rsquo;re off,&rdquo; he
shouted, fairly beside himself with joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;the race and then the
long, long trail. Mountains, rivers, sunshine,
storms, camp beneath a rocky ledge or in the
midst of dark spruce trees. On and on, and
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mine,&rdquo; he murmured. There was new
fire in his fine old eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />A BRIGHT NEW DREAM</h2>
<p>In the meantime, life was not dull on &ldquo;Rainbow
Farm,&rdquo; as Mary had lovingly named
their little claim in the happy Matamuska
valley. As winter came blowing in from the
north, some settlers, discouraged by the too
frank breezes that swept through their green
log cabins, sold out and sailed for home. From
these Mark purchased two fine flocks of chickens.
These called for a snug log cabin chicken
house, more work, and added hopes for the
future.</p>
<p>Every one settled down to the routine of
winter&rsquo;s work, all but Madam Chicaski. She
did the most unusual things and obtained the
most astonishing results. Having polished and
oiled her large pile of rusty traps, she one day
threw them, a full hundred pounds, over her
ample back, then disappeared over the nearest
hill. She remained away until long after
dark. Mary was beginning to worry about her
when, all bent over with fatigue, but smiling
as ever, she appeared empty-handed at the
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>After consuming a prodigious amount of
cornmeal mush, she sat dreaming by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renewing her youth,&rdquo; Mary whispered.</p>
<p>Mark nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>What was their surprise when three days
later she appeared with five foxes, four minks
and a dozen muskrats, all prime furs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you a good long coat,&rdquo; she held the
muskrat skins before Mary&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Bye and
bye many more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for you perhaps a cape,&rdquo; she held up
the mink skins as she nodded to Mrs. Hughes.
&ldquo;Who knows? The minks, they are harder to
catch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the fox skins?&rdquo; Mark asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To buy more traps, always more traps,&rdquo;
was the big woman&rsquo;s enthusiastic response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is money in it,&rdquo; Mark said to Dave
McQueen next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if she&rsquo;ll show us the tricks,&rdquo; Dave
agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She will,&rdquo; Mark declared. And she did.
As Mark followed her about he saw how she
cut snow thin as cardboard for concealing the
traps, how she scattered drops of oil about to
supply a scent leading to the traps, how she
discovered a mink&rsquo;s run at a river&rsquo;s brink, and
many other little secrets of the trapping world.</p>
<p>Soon both Mark and Dave were full-fledged
trappers with trap lines running away and
away into the hills.</p>
<p>Mary too was contributing her bit to the
family&rsquo;s wealth. The number of Speed Samson&rsquo;s
hunting trips with his airplane increased.
He had come to relish the food served at Rainbow
Farm. Knowing that his clients would
enjoy it as well, and at the same time be
charmed by the life there, he made a practice
of dropping down upon their small lake. More
often than not he brought his own supply of
meat. A hunk of venison, a loin of a young
moose, a leg of wild sheep, even brown bear
steak went into pot or roasting pan to reappear
as the delicious <i>piece de resistance</i> of a
bountiful meal. His clients got in the way
of leaving a folded bank note beneath each
plate. In this way Mary began to accumulate
quite a considerable little hoard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>At last, in a spending mood, she took the
train at Palmer and rode all the way to Anchorage.
There she made a surprising and, to
her, rather disturbing discovery.</p>
<p>Having mailed a letter, she stood looking
over the low railing into the rear of the postoffice
when her eye was caught by a pile of
second-class mail. It was in sacks, but the
half-open sacks presented a strange picture.
Out of one a beautiful doll appeared to be
struggling. From a second a toy train, apparently
at full speed, had been arrested in
midtrack, while from another cautiously
peeped a woolly teddybear.</p>
<p>Leaning forward, Mary read the address on
one sack. &ldquo;Wales, Alaska. Where is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cape Prince of Wales, on Bering Straits
above Nome,&rdquo; said the postmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Way up there!&rdquo; Mary was surprised.
&ldquo;Christmas presents. Will they get there in
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In time for the 4th of July,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;Some teacher up there asked friends to contribute
to his tree for Eskimo children. These
sacks arrived too late for the last boat. Cost
a small fortune to send them by air mail, so
here they stay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&mdash;&rdquo; Mary exclaimed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s too
bad. Think what all those presents would
mean to the cute little Eskimo children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure, but that&rsquo;s what you get in the
North.&rdquo; The postmaster dismissed the matter
at that. But for Mary, forgetting the appealing
doll, the rushing train that did not rush,
and the peeping bear, was not so easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Florence had known they were
here!&rdquo; she thought as she turned away. &ldquo;Perhaps
they had not yet arrived. Anyway&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyway what? She did not exactly know.
She wished that she might own an airplane all
her own and go where she chose in this great
white world of the North. This, she knew, was
only a mad dream, so taking the train for
home, she settled down to the business of feeding
chickens, gathering eggs, and assisting in
the preparation of delicious meals.</p>
<p>And then one bright, clear day something
very strange happened. In a cutter drawn by
two prancing horses, Mr. Il-ay-ok, the Eskimo,
appeared at their door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse, please,&rdquo; the little man bowed low.
&ldquo;Mr. Speed Samson, he comes to this place
very soon. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so. I am convinced. With your kindness
I shall wait. It is important, so important
to my people.&rdquo; The little man bowed once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome to stay as long as you
like,&rdquo; was Mary&rsquo;s welcome.</p>
<p>The driver was dismissed. Mr. Il-ay-ok entered.
Mary experienced a cold shudder as
she thought, &ldquo;Peter Loome may follow on his
trail.&rdquo; But she introduced the little man to
her mother and did all in her power to make
him feel at home.</p>
<p>When, true to Il-ay-ok&rsquo;s prophecy, Speed
came zooming in from the sky, the little Eskimo,
nearly bursting out the door in his haste,
went racing down to the landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse, please,&rdquo; he exclaimed as Speed
stepped from the plane. &ldquo;You must take me
to Nome. I must go soon, perhaps at once.
You shall take me to Nome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says that?&rdquo; the aviator grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say it. I, Mr. Il-ay-ok.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Speed drawled, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must!&rdquo; sudden distress and rigid determination
shone in the little man&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must not,&rdquo; replied Speed. There was a
note of finality in his voice. &ldquo;This is the hunting
season. I have customers coming. I cannot
wire them not to come then go zooming
off on some wild goose chase to Nome. This
is my harvest. How much money you got?&rdquo;
he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, no money,&rdquo; Mr. Il-ay-ok&rsquo;s
face fell. &ldquo;But you shall be paid,&rdquo; he was up
and at it again. &ldquo;My people they have fox
skins, very fine fox skins, red, white, cross
fox, silver gray fox. You shall have many fox
skins. You shall sell them for much money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; Speed&rsquo;s face
sobered. In the little man&rsquo;s face he had read
sincere distress. Speed was a kindly soul. &ldquo;It
is truly impossible for me to give up my work
now. Perhaps in three or four weeks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; the little man&rsquo;s voice rose shrill
and eager. &ldquo;Before January the first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Mary breathed, suddenly enchanted
with a bright idea. &ldquo;Before Christmas, you
must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You must go too?&rdquo; Speed cried,
banteringly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I might,&rdquo; the girl could scarcely believe
her voice, it was the first time she had ever
thought of it. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she added hurriedly
to conceal her embarrassment, &ldquo;you are to be
Santa Claus to a hundred Eskimo children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am Santa Claus,&rdquo; said Speed, seizing
her hand, &ldquo;you shall be little Miss Santa Claus.
I don&rsquo;t know what it is all about, but here,
shake on it.&rdquo; He gave her hand a hearty
squeeze.</p>
<p>Il-ay-ok rode back to Anchorage in Speed&rsquo;s
plane and there, for a time, the matter rested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />&ldquo;THEY ARE OFF&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In Nome each twenty-four hours that passed
saw the great race just one day nearer.
Each day the excitement over this event increased.
The prize this year was large. Men
of means had contributed generously. Though
thought of winning for the honor of the
&ldquo;Fresh-Dough Club&rdquo; was ever uppermost in
Jodie&rsquo;s mind, and in Florence&rsquo;s when she indulged
in strange day-dreams, the prize was
not entirely forgotten. Jodie had been let in
on the secret of the lost mine. Once the race
was won, or lost, it was planned that they
should be away at once on their search for
that mine. And the prize money would go far
toward providing them with the very necessary
grub-stake.</p>
<p>Little wonder then that, while keeping one
eye on her own gray team&mdash;just in case something
happened&mdash;Florence always had the
other turned upon Jodie&rsquo;s fine dogs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The crack of the starter&rsquo;s gun was only
three days away when, as Jodie came in from
his daily practice run, Florence met him on
the street. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with old
Sparks?&rdquo; she asked, nodding at the right hand
wheel dog. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem quite up to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been lagging all day,&rdquo; Jodie&rsquo;s brow wrinkled.
&ldquo;Off his feed a little, I guess. I&rsquo;ll cut
him out tomorrow. He&rsquo;ll be O. K. after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jodie,&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s tone was low, serious, &ldquo;do
you watch your dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing I do.&rdquo; He stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jodie, there&rsquo;s talk of gambling going on
among those foreigners, you know. They
might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Jodie replied wearily. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
not get to my dogs. The kennel is right
against my bunk. Besides, from now on, Az-az-ruk,
a half-breed, is going to watch them
at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad. Good-bye, Jodie.&rdquo; The girl was
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>That night Florence sat a long time by the
fire. She was thinking hard. What Jodie had
told her had not entirely reassured her. One
of his dogs did not appear to be right for the
race. What if another and perhaps another
began to wear down under the strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d lose,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose I enter the race with the
grays?&rdquo; A thrill ran up her spine. How she&rsquo;d
love it. Always her sturdy body had cried out
for action. She had swum a swift flowing
mile-wide river on a dare. She had climbed
mountains alone. She had done all manner of
wild things on trapeze and ropes, just for the
thrill of it. And now this race! All else seemed
to pale into insignificance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;would it be fair
to Jodie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One more day passed, then another. It was
the forenoon of the day before the coming of
the great event. Only a few hours were left
for entering the race. Yesterday she had
driven her gray streaks over fifty miles of
tough trails. How magnificently they had performed!
With such a team, who could stay
out? And yet&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Fifteen minutes later her mind was made
up. Jodie passed her. He was off for a short
spin. Short as had been her experience at
driving and judging dogs, she knew at a glance
that all was not well. Four of his dogs were
now imitating the actions of a very weary rag
doll. Their heads hung low. Their tails
drooped. Each forward sprint called for a
great effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That half-breed must have slept on his
watch,&rdquo; her eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>When Jodie came trotting back two hours
later, she met him in the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa! Whoa, there!&rdquo; he shouted at his
dogs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; The smile
that he gave the girl was an uncertain one.</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s heart was in her throat. Would
he hate her now? &ldquo;Jodie,&rdquo; she replied soberly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the race with the grays. I&mdash;I just
had to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; seizing her hand, he gripped it until
it hurt. &ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;d enter. It&rsquo;s a tough
grind all that way and back, so I didn&rsquo;t want
to urge you. But you&mdash;you&rsquo;ll make it, and
you&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jodie,&rdquo; her voice was deep and low,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only win if I see you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he swallowed hard, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s sporting
of you, but you&mdash;you can&rsquo;t do that. You
go in to win. Forget me. Forget everything.
Go after those gray wolves and make them
do their best, start to finish. And here&mdash;here&rsquo;s
luck to the best man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Ginger,&rdquo; his voice dropped.
&ldquo;Mush along you!&rdquo; He trotted away behind
his team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; Florence murmured, &ldquo;this is the
North. No wonder they call it &lsquo;God&rsquo;s country.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;You go to sleep, girl,&rdquo; Tom Kennedy said
to her at nine that night. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay up till
morning. You never can tell what&rsquo;s going to
happen in the wee small hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God made a mistake,&rdquo; his keen gray eyes
took her in&mdash;squirrel skin cap, bright orange
mackinaw, corduroy knickers and all, &ldquo;you
should have been a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl can do what any boy can, if she&rsquo;s
strong and keeps herself fit,&rdquo; she flashed back
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No girl&rsquo;s ever run in the great race before,&rdquo;
he reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes it so fascinating. Who
wants to be forever doing what others do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be an honor to your old granddad.
I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad you came,&rdquo; his voice was husky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped you would be,&rdquo; she replied simply.</p>
<p>All that night, with lights out and with the
inner door ajar, Tom Kennedy sat by the window
that overlooked the distant, moonlit hills
and the dog kennels close at hand. Once
Florence stirred in her sleep, then suddenly
sat up. What was it? Had she heard a shot?
She did hear the door softly closed, she was
sure of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it, grandfather?&rdquo; she asked
sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I saw a skunk. Can&rsquo;t be sure.
He&rsquo;s gone now, went mighty fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skunks,&rdquo; she thought dreamily, &ldquo;do they
have skunks in Alaska?&rdquo; What did it matter?
Once more she was asleep.</p>
<p>And then the great day dawned.</p>
<p>All the little city&rsquo;s population was out to
see them start. A picturesque throng it was.
Indians, Eskimos, trappers, traders, gold hunters,
shop keepers, adventurers, they were all
there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>The five contestants drew for places. The
teams would start one hour apart. Many hours
would pass before their return. When they
began straggling back, the throng would be
there again. Meanwhile, snug and warm in
their cabins, they would with shouts of joy
or howls of disappointment listen to shortwave
radio accounts of the race.</p>
<p>Jodie drew first place. Smitty Valentine,
hero of many another race and favorite of
old-timers, drew second, Florence was third,
and the two other sourdough contenders drew
up the rear.</p>
<p>With a wild round of applause, Jodie was
away in a cloud of fine driving snow.</p>
<p>For an hour the crowd lingered. Then, at
the crack of a pistol, with a shout and a flourish
of the whip, Smitty was away. Then such
a shout! &ldquo;Smitty! Smitty! Go, Smitty! Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence swallowed hard. The popularity
of this man had been honestly won. Tom Kennedy
had said he was a real old-timer, and
Tom knew. And yet, &ldquo;Time marches on.
Youth must be served. Unless youth is given
a place in the sun, there can be no progress.&rdquo;
These words of a truly great man rang in her
ears. They must win. It was Jodie or she.
Which should it be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>The crowd did not linger to see her off. Oh,
yes, the younger crowd, her gang, the tried
and true, would stick. As for the others, who
could blame them? There was a bitter cold
wind from the west. And who was she? Only
a girl from somewhere or other. What place
had a girl in such a race? Hundred miles!
What, indeed! Probably lose her team in some
wild storm, they may have been thinking. At
thought of this, she set her teeth and clenched
her fists. She would show them. Girl or no
girl, they should see.</p>
<p>A thin cheer arose from the faithful few
when at last the pistol sounded out the hour
and with a quiet &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; to her leader,
she headed straight out over the long, long
trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />THE PHANTOM LEADER</h2>
<p>For nine long hours, save for three brief
pauses to rest her dogs and catch some
light refreshments for herself, Florence followed
the long, winding trail that led away
and away one hundred miles into the great beyond.
Now and then a thrill coursed through
her being. Other than this there was no sign
that this was a race, and not just one more
joy ride. True, as she mounted the crest of a
steep ridge, she did catch a fleeting glimpse
of a speeding dog team. Was it her nearest
opponent, Smitty Valentine? There was no
way to tell. He had left an hour before her.
Should she reach the finish just fifty-nine minutes
behind him, the race was hers. If not&mdash;well,
Jodie was still further ahead, perhaps the
race was to be his. Who could tell?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Plop-plop-plop went her feet on the snow.
Her light basket sled was empty, yet she never
rode&mdash;her fleet gray hounds must have every
advantage. Plop-plop-plop on the hard-packed
snow. Here a covey of white ptarmigan rose
fluttering from the trail, there a sly white wolf
mounted a ridge to stare after her, here a
column of smoke rose above the tree tops and
there two little brown men, their dog-team
drawn off the trail, watched in silence as she
passed. What a weird, wild world was this!</p>
<p>Strangely enough, as she reached the last
trail-house prepared for the required twenty
minute rest before starting back over the trail,
she learned that three racers&mdash;Jodie, Smitty,
and herself&mdash;were running neck and neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a half mile between them,&rdquo; the radio
announcer droned. &ldquo;The two last teams driven
by Scot Jordan and Sinrock Charlie now lag
behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprise has been expressed in many quarters,&rdquo;
he droned on. &ldquo;Surprise at the endurance
of the girl racer, Florence Huyler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she had them surprised? Florence smiled
grimly as she gulped down a large mug of
steaming coffee. &ldquo;Surprised! Huh!&rdquo; she said
aloud. Then to the trail-house keeper&rsquo;s wife,
&ldquo;Call me, please, when the time is up. I&rsquo;m going
to sleep.&rdquo; She threw herself down upon
a couch and was at once fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>In her sleep she dreamed&mdash;odd dream it
was, too. In it she saw the huge Madam Chicaski
placing seven candlesticks on the mantel
at Rainbow Farm. Gold they must have been,
for they shone like the sun. Then she saw the
woman pouring something out of a huge copper
kettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; she whispered in her dream. &ldquo;Gold
coins, hundreds and hundreds of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were all poured on the table, some
rolling on the floor. Then a little, dark man,
Mr. Il-ay-ok, approached the table and began
gathering them up. &ldquo;I need them for my
people,&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
<p>Florence awoke with a start. The dream
was at an end. The trail-house matron was
shaking her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time is up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>One minute more and the girl was on her
way back. But that dream, it lingered in the
back of her mind. What did it mean? Probably
nothing. Perhaps this, that life&rsquo;s adventures
are never at an end, that if she won
this race, it was to be not an end but a beginning
of other things. There was Madam Chicaski
and her supposed treasure, Mr. Il-ay-ok
and his people, and her grandfather&rsquo;s mine.
&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;goes on and on and, like
one&rsquo;s shadow, adventure goes before it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now once again she thought only of the
race. Once again, as in a dream, the long,
white trail glided on beneath her weary feet.</p>
<p>The next stop, twenty miles along the homeward
trek, brought bad news&mdash;Jodie was falling
behind, already he had lost twenty minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his dogs,&rdquo; Florence explained to the
sympathizing trail-house keeper. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything happens in dis race,&rdquo; encouraged
her host, &ldquo;yust anyting at all. You yust
keep pushin&rsquo; dem sled handles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep pushing,&rdquo; she smiled. She was
thinking not of herself but of Jodie. How was
it all to end?</p>
<p>Hours later she found herself approaching
&ldquo;Twenty-Mile House,&rdquo; the last stop before
the home stretch. Jodie was now quite definitely
out of the race. But&mdash;she squared her
shoulders at the thought&mdash;Smitty Valentine,
her closest opponent, was twenty minutes behind
her. A slim lead this, but if only she
could hold it. If&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Of a sudden, Gray Chief, her leader, gave a
yelp of pain, then began hopping along on
three feet. Time after time the brave fellow
put that foot to the snow, only to lift it again.</p>
<p>In consternation she stopped the dogs to
race ahead and examine that foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a scratch,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Just one
of those things that happen to a dog in a race.&rdquo;
Drawing her sheath knife, she cut the leader&rsquo;s
draw rope, then, lifting him in her arms, carried
him back to deposit him on the sled. He
whined piteously, but, with almost human wisdom,
appeared to know that for the time at
least, he was through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must bring you all in,&rdquo; the girl spoke to
the dogs, there were tears in her voice. &ldquo;Who
could be cruel enough to leave you behind on
the frozen trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Twenty-Mile House, with sinking heart,
she learned that already her slim lead was lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smitty Valentine and Florence Huyler running
neck and neck,&rdquo; the announcer droned.
&ldquo;Betting is four to one on Smitty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is!&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s face flushed. Gladly
she would have plunged at once into the race,
but rules forbade&mdash;twenty minutes for every
racer at every rest spot, those were the orders.
Refusing an offer of refreshments, she
threw herself on a cot in the corner and was
at once lost to the world.</p>
<p>This time she did not dream. And yet, when
she was awakened, she imagined she was
dreaming, for there above her was a familiar
face, At-a-tak, the Eskimo girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go with you last mile. Say I could, those
men. I not touch you, not touch sled, not
touch dog, just go, say that, those men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence found herself strangely cheered by
this news. If this last long mile were to be
run in misery, she would at least have company.</p>
<p>Scarcely were they on their way than the
Eskimo girl began shouting strange guttural
commands to the team. This appeared to help.
Florence was cheered. The next thing At-a-tak
did was strange. Dragging Gray Chief
from the sled, she said, &ldquo;All right, you go.
I come. I bring him.&rdquo; Reluctantly Florence
drove on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>But now new trouble appeared on the horizon.
A storm was coming. Sifting fine snow
at her feet, it rose to her knees, her waist, her
shoulders, then began cutting at her cheeks.</p>
<p>To her vast surprise, out of this murk of
snow-fog from behind her came a girl and a
dog&mdash;At-a-tak and Gray Chief. And, wonder
of wonders, Gray Chief was trotting on all
fours. What had the native girl done to him?
No time to ask. Some native trick of magic.
She saw the leader take his place at the front,
then felt the sled lurch forward.</p>
<p>The grim battle went on. The storm increased.
Eyes half blinded by snow, the brave
dogs forged forward into a day that was all
but night.</p>
<p>Would they win? Could they? No more
reports now. The end of the trail lay straight
ahead. The advantage was all with Smitty.
He would be through when she was still an
hour from the goal. How dared she hope?
And yet she did dare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much depends on this race,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much,&rdquo; At-a-tak echoed hoarsely at her
side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>And then came one more surprising burst
of speed. &ldquo;Good old Gray Chief!&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Go! Go! Go! Go, Gray Chief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; In spite of rules, At-a-tak gripped
her arm as they ran. &ldquo;Look! It is the Phantom
Leader. Now you win! It is good! Nagoo-va-ruk-tuk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straining her eyes, Florence caught a
glimpse of something white before her on the
trail. Was it wolf, dog, or phantom? She
could not tell, nor did she care, enough that,
for the moment at least, her speed had been
increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t last,&rdquo; she murmured to herself. &ldquo;It
will disappear, that beast, or phantom of the
storm. Or, perhaps he will lead us astray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her surprise and great joy, it did last.
Ever and anon, as the wild drive of the snow
faded, she caught sight of that drifting spot
of white. Now it was there and now gone, but
for Gray Chief and his band it was always
there and always, in some superhuman way,
it inspired them to fresh endeavor.</p>
<p>Only at the crest of the last ridge did the
&ldquo;phantom&rdquo; vanish. And then it was but a
short mile, all down hill, to the last stake, to
defeat or victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Than&mdash;thank God for the Phantom Leader,&rdquo;
she exclaimed as, leaping on her sled and
using one foot for a brake, she went gliding
down, down, down&mdash;to what? She would soon
know.</p>
<p>As she came into view, she heard their wild
scream from half a mile away. &ldquo;Our gang,&rdquo;
her throat tightened. They would be loyal.
Win or lose, she would receive a round of
cheers. Good old Arctic gang! How good
they had been to take her in!</p>
<p>Three minutes more and she caught the
refrain of their wild chant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win! You win! We win! We win!
Sourdough? No! No! No! Fresh-Dough!
Fresh-Dough! We win! We win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There could be no doubting the truth of
this chant. She read it in their faces when, as
she shot across the line, they seized her, tossed
her upon a broad expanse of dry walrus skin,
then lifting her high, began bearing her away
in triumph.</p>
<p>At the clubroom door they paused. Then,
in a spirit of fun, they allowed the skin to sag.
Two score hands gave a quick yank and the
heroine of the hour rose in air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>This was not new to Florence. &ldquo;Yea!&rdquo; she
shouted. &ldquo;Come on! Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Balancing
herself in the center of this strange blanket,
she stood erect and, with the next lusty pull,
shot skyward like a rocket.</p>
<p>Three times she sought the stars. Three
times she scanned that throng for a face. She
was looking for Jodie. He was not there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on in,&rdquo; they shouted in a chorus.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll celebrate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;Please. Not
tonight. I&rsquo;m dead. Tomorrow night we&rsquo;ll
whoop it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! All right!&rdquo; they screamed. &ldquo;Big
brass band and all. Tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, seizing proud Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s arm,
she marched away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Jodie?
Didn&rsquo;t he get in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Oh, sure!&rdquo; the old man replied. &ldquo;Of
course, he lost. Three dogs went wrong, but
he came in, all the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When he got to the cabin,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;he
just tumbled on the cot and fell asleep. Before
that, though, he said, &lsquo;Be sure to wake
me up when she comes in,&rsquo; meaning you. But,
you know, I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to wake
him. He&rsquo;s still fast asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last was not quite true, at least they
found Jodie standing just inside the door when
they arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; he held out a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jodie, I&rsquo;m sorry you couldn&rsquo;t win,&rdquo; the
girl&rsquo;s voice was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he stood silent for an instant,
then a mischievous look stole into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;<i>we</i> won the race.
Just the way a man and his wife killed the
bear. Ever hear of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; Florence sat
down. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Jodie, &ldquo;there was a
man, his wife and two children in a shack
when a great big bear entered. The man went
to the rafters. The woman, being hampered
by children clinging to her skirts, stayed on
the floor. Seizing an axe, she killed the bear.
Whereupon the man climbed down shouting,
&lsquo;Mary! Mary! We killed the bear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he added soberly, &ldquo;now we&rsquo;ve
won the race, what are we to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Put half the prize money in the bank for
Mr. Il-ay-ok, spend the rest for grub, a new
rifle or two and some ammunition, then go in
search of Grandfather&rsquo;s lost mine,&rdquo; she panted
all in one breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds great!&rdquo; the boy exclaimed. &ldquo;Do I
go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. We&rsquo;ll be generous,&rdquo; the girl
laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you do nearly all the
digging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mulligan&rsquo;s on,&rdquo; said Tom Kennedy, dragging
up a chair. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand!&rdquo; Florence was ready for just that.
Never before had she been so hungry and so
sleepy all in one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jodie,&rdquo; she said with the sudden start of
one who had recalled something very unusual.
&ldquo;What about this Phantom Leader?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, have you seen him?&rdquo; Jodie grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;sure I&rsquo;ve seen him, at least that&rsquo;s
what At-a-tak called him. &lsquo;The Phantom
Leader.&rsquo; And Jodie,&rdquo; her tone was serious,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I won the race. He ran before us,
miles and miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of such a thing,&rdquo; Jodie stared.
&ldquo;Probably a white wolf daring your dogs to
get him, or perhaps a wandering dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the Phantom Leader, h-m-m&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a grand little Eskimo legend. This Phantom
is a real ghost hound who appears to help
people out of trouble. An Eskimo woman is
lost in a storm, he appears to lead her home.
A hunter lost in the drifting floes, starving
and freezing, sees the Phantom Leader, follows
him and finds land. You know, regular
thing, stuff dreams are made of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Florence, resuming her
meal, &ldquo;I hope to meet the Phantom again.
He brought us rare good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giving herself over to the business of eating,
she consumed a vast amount of mulligan
stew and a great heap of hot biscuits. After
that she dragged her reluctant feet to her
cubby-hole of a bedroom and, creeping between
blankets, slept the clock around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />THE GOLDEN QUEST</h2>
<p>Florence was seated at the table the
next day doing justice to a late afternoon
breakfast of hot cakes and coffee when Jodie
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plans have been changed,&rdquo; he gave her a
rare smile. &ldquo;No whoopee, but a grand ball.
That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s going to be. Full dress affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full dress?&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s lips parted in a gasp
of surprise. Then with a sigh, &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo;
she opened the draft in the small cook stove
and set the flatirons on.</p>
<p>A half hour later she stood before Jodie
garbed in the only silk dress she had with her,
a full-length affair of midnight blue, trimmed
in ermine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keen!&rdquo; was the boy&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Needs
just one northern touch. You wait,&rdquo; he burst
through the door and was gone.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later he reappeared with a
soft, bulky package under his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are.&rdquo; With one swift movement
he cast away the paper wrapping and threw
a gorgeous white fox fur about her neck. &ldquo;And
there you are,&rdquo; he stood back admiringly.
&ldquo;Queen of the ball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jodie! Is it mine?&rdquo; her eyes shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure &rsquo;nuff. Present from the gang. Great
stuff, I&rsquo;d say&mdash;dog-musher one day, queen of
the ball the next. Nothing like contrast in
this jolly old world of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jodie was not wrong. The winter nights
are long in Alaska, but not too long for a
jolly good time. A waxed floor, a peppy ten-piece
orchestra, including two Eskimo drummers,
a joyous company and sixteen hours of
darkness, who could ask for more? Florence
did not ask. She made the most of every
fleeting hour. For, she thought in one sober
moment, before another forty-eight hours
have flown, we&rsquo;ll be on the trail once more.</p>
<p>And so they were, off on the long trek that,
they hoped, would bring them to the lost gold
mine and to the end of good old Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s
lifelong dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>They trailed away into the cold, gray dawn,
two teams and four people&mdash;Tom Kennedy,
Florence, Jodie, and At-a-tak. Not only had
the Eskimo girl gladly loaned the gray team
for the occasion, but she had offered to accompany
them as seamstress for their native
clothing.</p>
<p>Not a word was said as the city faded into
the distance and blue-gray hills loomed ahead.
They were off on the great quest, man&rsquo;s age-long
search for gold.</p>
<p>They had been trotting along behind their
sleds for some ten miles when, as it will on
Arctic trails, the wind began pelting them
with hard particles of snow. This time, however,
that wind was with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Jodie breathed joyously, &ldquo;twenty below
zero and the wind at our backs! What
time we shall make!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at the whirl of that snow!&rdquo; Florence
was alarmed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lose the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; Tom Kennedy assured her. &ldquo;The
first few days of trail are like a paved road
to an oldtimer. It&rsquo;s the end that counts. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Florence broke in, pointing away
before them. &ldquo;The Phantom Leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; At-a-tak echoed. &ldquo;The Phantom
Leader.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> something,&rdquo; Jodie agreed. &ldquo;Something
white. It moves. Now it is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! There it is,&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s voice was
eager. &ldquo;Jodie! Grandfather! The Phantom
Leader! That means good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Jodie was straining his eyes for
a better look. &ldquo;There! See! He has stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or&mdash;or fallen,&rdquo; Florence was ready to go
racing on ahead of the team. Jodie held her
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; he counselled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There! He <i>is</i> gone!&rdquo; the girl cried
a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over a ridge. We&rsquo;ll see him again,&rdquo; Tom
Kennedy explained.</p>
<p>Indeed they did see him again and so close
that Florence imagined herself looking at a
pair of eyes burning their way out of a field
of white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s a dog,&rdquo; Jodie exclaimed in a
hoarse whisper, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the whitest one I&rsquo;ve ever
seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! He&rsquo;s down!&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s voice was
tense with emotion. &ldquo;Poor fellow! He must
be hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who ever heard of a ghost being hurt?&rdquo;
Jodie laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there he goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t last forever,&rdquo; Jodie cracked a
whip. His team sped on.</p>
<p>For a full half mile they burned up the trail,
then with a suddenness that was startling,
they all piled up in a heap at the back side of
a snow bank. And there lying at Florence&rsquo;s
feet was one of the most piteous sights the
girl&rsquo;s eyes had rested upon: a collie dog, white
as snow and so emaciated with hunger that
every bone could be counted. He was whining
piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; she murmured as she dug into
her pack for cooked reindeer meat. &ldquo;Poor old
Phantom Leader!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m dumbed!&rdquo; was all Jodie could
say. Tom Kennedy said nothing at all. At-a-tak
stared as one must stare when, for the first
time, he sees a ghost within his reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he come from?&rdquo; Florence asked
as the dog voiced thanks for the food offered
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from Nome,&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;No such
dog there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some reindeer herder&rsquo;s dog, or a miner&rsquo;s,
like Jack London&rsquo;s Buck in the <i>Call of the
Wild</i>,&rdquo; said Jodie. &ldquo;Find his story and you
may learn of tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No time now for such musings. The long
trail lay ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take him along for luck,&rdquo; said Florence.
What luck? How could she know now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to, of course,&rdquo; they all agreed.
&ldquo;No true Alaskan ever leaves a starving dog
on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the &ldquo;Phantom Leader&rdquo; was stowed away
on top of the canvas packing on Jodie&rsquo;s sled,
and the little caravan once more moved on
into the great unknown.</p>
<p class="tb">Long days followed, days of pushing forward
along untracked rivers and over low
mountains where no man lived, and no living
creature moved save the fox, the wolf, and
the snowshoe rabbit. Nights there were when
the sky was like a blue sea filled with the lights
of a thousand ships. An Arctic gale came
sweeping down upon them. Blotting out the
landscape, it drove them into camp. For two
days and nights with their little sheet-iron
stove beating back the frost, they lay on their
sleeping bags listening to the beat of snow
against their tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Their food supply dwindled. No wild caribou
had been seen, but joy suddenly filled
their hearts when at last they came to the spot
where the river they followed forked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Tom Kennedy exulted, &ldquo;is the fork.
Up this stream we must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did they have faith in his judgment? How
could they doubt it? Yet Florence thought of
their meager food supply and shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jodie and I will go out to look for game,&rdquo;
said Tom Kennedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. We&rsquo;ll have some great luck,&rdquo; Jodie
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set up camp and cut some wood.&rdquo; Florence
was no weakling. She could play a man&rsquo;s
part.</p>
<p>As for At-a-tak, she wandered away in
search of snowshoe rabbits&rsquo; tracks. More than
once her cunningly set snares had provided
their pot with a delicious stew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>It was after Florence had set up camp and
while the others were still away that she began
hearing puzzling sounds. Coming from
the distance, they sounded like the crackle of
a wood fire. But there was no fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked of the white collie,
the &ldquo;Phantom Leader,&rdquo; who lay on the snow
close beside her. Well fed and cared for now,
the dog had regained his strength. He had
become a prime favorite with all. But oh! how
he could eat! And in the harness he was just
no good at all. Neither his nature nor his
training fitted him for this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Phantom,&rdquo; the girl murmured.
&ldquo;Earn your dinner. Tell me what those sounds
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer the dog rose to his haunches
and growled. His sharp nose pointed straight
down the trail over which they had come.
Each moment the faint clatter increased in
volume. At the same time a burst of wind
swept up the valley and a swirl of fine particles
cut at the girl&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Another storm!&rdquo; Still she waited
and listened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Phantom! What is it, you&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly
she broke short off. As her whisper ceased,
her lips parted, her eyes bulged in astonishment,
for at that instant from behind a clump
of low spruce trees a head appeared. The
head, long and white with small mottled
brown spots, carried a pair of massive antlers.
The creature stood staring at them, apparently
quite unafraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a caribou!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Food,
plenty of food for dogs and men. All the rifles
gone, too. And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The creature was beautiful. If a rifle were
in her hands could she have killed it? She
did not know.</p>
<p>Then like a flash the truth came to her, this
was not a caribou but a reindeer, a domestic
reindeer. Caribou are brown. Only reindeer
are white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are others,&rdquo; she said to the dog,
&ldquo;many more. Listen!&rdquo; As she stood there in
silence there came again that confused crack-cracking.
That, she realized, was many reindeer
crack-cracking their hoofs as they trotted
over the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reindeer,&rdquo; she whispered in awed excitement,
&ldquo;many reindeer here, two hundred miles
from the nearest range. Something wrong
somewhere, that&rsquo;s sure!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Truly here was a situation. Her companions
were gone. Here was a problem to be solved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might be back any time,&rdquo; she told
herself, &ldquo;but they may not come before the
storm breaks.&rdquo; Something seemed to tell her
that here was a matter that needed looking
into. Had this herd wandered away, been
stampeded by wolves, or&mdash;her heart skipped a
beat&mdash;had some northern outlaws driven the
reindeer into the wilds that they might live
upon them and perhaps later sell the unmarked
yearlings?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be Eskimo,&rdquo; she thought. Her
grandfather had told how the deer had at one
time belonged to the Government and to the
Eskimo, and how white men had gained control
of great herds, how some of the Eskimo,
feeling themselves defeated, had turned bitter
and at one time or another killed deer that
did not belong to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be dangerous to go and see what
it&rsquo;s all about,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flash of light had caught her eye, a gleam
from the white reindeer&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;A marker,&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;John Bowman&rsquo;s marker! Ah,
that&rsquo;s different!&rdquo; She had seen Bowman&rsquo;s
deer at Nome. &ldquo;Come on, Phantom!&rdquo; she
called to the dog. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to look into
this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Inspired by this call to service, Florence
climbed up the slope. Then, crouching low
that she might not startle the reindeer, she
followed back along the trail.</p>
<p>Behind her, sticking close to her heels, was
the &ldquo;Phantom Leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Phantom,&rdquo; she murmured. The
dog let out an all but inaudible yap-yap.</p>
<p>A biting breath of air struck her cheek.
Snow rattled against her parka. The storm
was on its way.</p>
<p>Creeping down the slope, she peered through
the branches. &ldquo;Reindeer,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;still
more reindeer. There must be hundreds!
Must be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she drew back among the dark
boughs. Had she caught a glimpse of a skulking
figure? She could not be sure. The dog
crowded close to her, trembling. Why did
he tremble? Could he sense danger?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Creeping back up the ridge, she once more
turned her back upon her camp. She must
make some fresh discoveries. But the storm
was beginning in earnest now. All about her
were swirls of blinding snow. Now she could
see for a distance of forty yards, and now but
a few feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild spot this,&rdquo; she said to the dog. &ldquo;Reindeer
will be stampeded by the storm. They
may rush over the ridge and perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly a plan was forming in her mind.
She would get behind the herd, then drive it
forward to the narrow sheltered valley at the
edge of which their camp was made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be safe there,&rdquo; she told herself. But
if there were outlaws, marauders behind this
herd? She shuddered. Ah, well, she must risk
it. She owed that to her friend and her grandfather&rsquo;s
friend, John Bowman.</p>
<p>For a quarter of an hour she battled her way
against the storm. Then, seized with sudden
fear lest she lose contact with the herd, she
hurried down the slope.</p>
<p>She had just reached the bed of the frozen
stream when, for a space of seconds, the air
cleared. Through that half-light she saw two
dark figures. They were moving up the slope.
Were they a man and a sled, or two men?
She could not be sure. A second more and all
was blotted out in one wild whirl of snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Looking down, she saw what appeared to
be an answer to her question&mdash;a sled track in
the snow. Bending down, she examined it
carefully. &ldquo;Eskimo sled,&rdquo; was her verdict. The
tracks were too close together for a white
man&rsquo;s sled, and the runners too broad. They
were wooden runners, made of driftwood.</p>
<p>Already she was out of touch with the herd.
Whatever happened, she must hasten on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phantom, where are you?&rdquo; she exclaimed
in sudden consternation. Where indeed was
the collie? He was gone, had vanished into
the ever-increasing storm. A feeling of loneliness,
almost of despair, swept over her. Why
had she taken such chances? In a strange land
one must exercise caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to get going.&rdquo; As she hurled herself
forward before the storm, she was fairly lifted
from her feet by the violence of the wind.
Now spinning like a top and now sailing along
like a kite over the snow, she missed a spruce
tree by inches, went hurtling over some young
firs, then tripped over tangled branches to at
last land sprawling on all fours over a snow
bank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! What a&mdash;&rdquo; she broke short off to
listen. What was that? A dog barking?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; She was on her feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Phantom and I know the meaning of that
bark. He hasn&rsquo;t started a rabbit, nor is he
afraid. He&rsquo;s driving cattle, reindeer! And why
not? He&rsquo;s a collie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again, more cautiously, she took up
the trail. Her course was clear enough now.
All she had to do was to follow on, perhaps
give the dog a word of encouragement now
and then. She would herd the reindeer up the
ravine. Soon they would be at camp. From
that point the deer could spread out in the
narrow protected valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
Phantom now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught fleeting glimpses of the dog.
Now he was here, now there, and there. What
a fast worker he was! The moment a deer
lagged, he was at its heels.</p>
<p>And the reindeer? She saw them indistinctly,
like a picture out of focus. But there must
be hundreds of them. How had they been
driven all this way? And why?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>She cast apprehensive glances to right, left,
then back. There had been something secretive
about the way that man back there on
the trail had acted. She saw no one now. The
snow fog was closing in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, Phantom! Go after them!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Good old Phantom!&rdquo; How glad she was that
they had responded to the Phantom&rsquo;s appeal
and had saved him.</p>
<p>Just then she caught the gleam of a light,
and heard a shout. It was her grandfather&rsquo;s
voice. She was nearing the camp. It was all
right now. The deer were safe from the storm
and from&mdash;from what else? She could not be
sure. Only one thing she knew, they were
John Bowman&rsquo;s reindeer and John Bowman
was her friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>An hour later, with the wind tearing and
cracking about their tent, the four of them,
grandfather, Jodie, Florence, and At-a-tak,
sat on their sleeping bags in awed silence listening
to the rush and roar of the storm. At
their feet, dreaming day-dreams, lay the collie
who on that day had covered himself with
glory. That splendid herd was safe from the
storm. Tomorrow when the storm had gone
roaring on towards the north, they would begin
unraveling the mystery that had to do
with the presence of these reindeer in this
wild, uninhabited region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wandered away,&rdquo; said grandfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody stole,&rdquo; said At-a-tak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the regular herders are taking
them somewhere,&rdquo; said Jodie.</p>
<p>But who could surely know? They must
wait and see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />THE BLACK SEAL&rsquo;S TOOTH</h2>
<p>Florence stopped short in her tracks.
It was early next morning. She had wandered
some distance from camp. Bending over,
she picked something from the snow. That
something was brightly colored orange and
green. It had shone out of the solid white of
snow at her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tracks,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;Eskimo tracks, and
now this.&rdquo; The thing she held in her hand was
strange. A small leather packet, it was decorated
with masses of bright beads. As she
examined it she saw that it had been sewn up
tight, but she could feel some small hard objects
within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold nuggets, perhaps,&rdquo; her imagination
soared. Two bits of leather thong led out
from the bag. That they had been one piece
she knew at once. &ldquo;Worn about the neck,&rdquo;
she concluded, &ldquo;and the thong broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next instant she was calling, &ldquo;At-a-tak!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; The Eskimo girl burst through
a clump of evergreens. &ldquo;Ah-ne-ca!&rdquo; she exclaimed
at sight of the little sack. &ldquo;Came from
Russia, this one. Not Eskimo, no! no!
<i>Chuckches</i> from Russia. What you call it?
Charm! Keep bad spirits away, think that,
this <i>Chuckche</i> man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;it might keep bad
spirits away, but it didn&rsquo;t keep bad ideas out
of his mind. He and his friends tried to steal
five hundred of John Bowman&rsquo;s reindeer, that&rsquo;s
plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;&rdquo; her tone changed, &ldquo;looks as if
these natives had become frightened, leaving
us with the reindeer on our hands. Two hundred
miles from anywhere. What are we going
to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said At-a-tak. What she meant was,
&lsquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s a situation for you!&rsquo; And Florence
agreed with her. Here they were on a
golden quest, marching with dog teams and
supplies into the uncharted North in search
of a lost and hidden mine, and now of a sudden
they found themselves encamped with a
whole herd of reindeer belonging to a friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, we won&rsquo;t starve,&rdquo; the girl
laughed. &ldquo;Plenty of reindeer steak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said At-a-tak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go back,&rdquo; Florence decided suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed the Eskimo girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go on north,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
take the deer with us. We&rsquo;ve just got to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said At-a-tak.</p>
<p>It was the day after the storm. All was
white and quiet now. Florence and the Eskimo
girl had gone in search of a clue that
would give them a reason for the presence of
this valuable herd of reindeer in such a place.
Apparently they had found the answer. Here
and there were snow-blown tracks of dogs,
sleds and natives. These led away from the
narrow valley. Without question, these natives,
overcome by a desire to live easily off
that which belonged to another, had driven
these deer into the hills. At sight of white
men they had fled. Would they return? Florence
shuddered. &ldquo;Have to be on the watch,&rdquo;
she told herself. To At-a-tak she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! Let&rsquo;s go back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>When their report had been made, Tom
Kennedy agreed that they should take the
deer with them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll camp here until tomorrow
morning, give the deer a chance to
feed, then we&rsquo;ll press on up the fork to the
mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mine,&rdquo; his voice rose, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s still there.
Bound to be! Joe and me, we hid it, hid it
good and plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hid it?&rdquo; Florence wanted to ask. &ldquo;How
can you hide a gold mine?&rdquo; She did not ask.
She would wait and see for herself. Long ago
she had learned the uselessness of asking
questions when a little patient waiting would
permit one to answer them for oneself.</p>
<p>A short time later, in the shadow of a fir
tree, she cut the threads that closed that small
beaded bag, then shook into her hand three
bits of ivory. Two were white, the long, sharp
teeth of a fox, and one was black as night, the
tooth of a seal. This black one had been
buried perhaps for hundreds of years beneath
the sands of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck charm,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Wonder
if it will bring good luck to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hours later, in a dreamy sort of way she
was wondering this all over again. There was
need at this moment for luck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>She was seated beside the coals of a campfire.
The moon in all its glory hung above her.
Stretching across the sky the Milky Way
seemed a scarf of finest lace.</p>
<p>Her eyes, however, were not much upon the
sky. They roved the snowy slopes. They took
in every clump of fir and spruce. They rested
with pleasure upon the brown spots that were,
she knew, sleeping reindeer. She was guarding
camp. They had decided that it was best
to keep a watch. Jodie had all but insisted
upon keeping her watch, but to this she would
not listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as good a man as you are, even if I am
a girl,&rdquo; was her laughing challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chuckches</i>,&rdquo; she was thinking, &ldquo;how would
natives of Siberia come so far?&rdquo; And yet, the
charm in her pocket had come from Russia&mdash;Siberia&mdash;the
Arctic coast of Asia. At-a-tak
had assured her of that. How strange!</p>
<p>Then she thought of the hidden mine. They
would be there tomorrow. A feeling of pleased
excitement, like the day before Christmas, ran
through her being. Be there tomorrow. Would
they? Perhaps there was no mine worthy of
the name&mdash;only an old man&rsquo;s dream. Well,
even this had to be proved tomorrow. Tomorrow&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>She started from this reverie, then listened
sharply. Had there come an unaccustomed
sound, like someone talking low in the distance?</p>
<p>A sound did reach her ears, a short, sharp
barking. White foxes barking in the night.
But this other sound&mdash;could it be some wild
creature, perhaps a wolf, grumbling to his
mate?</p>
<p>After that the night was still. She thought
there had never before been such silence&mdash;the
great white silence of the North. She imagined
one might hear the rush of stars in their
orbits.</p>
<p>Then again that silence was broken. The
sound this time was very near, like the low
mush-mush of footsteps on the snow, it seemed
to come from the ridge above. Three clumps
of spruce trees were there. Anyone passing
from one to the other would be hidden. The
nearest was not twenty yards from the camp.
Her hands moved nervously as she sat watching
those low spruce trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>A moment passed, another, and yet another.
The silence appeared to deepen. Blue-gray
shadows of trees seemed to creep toward her.
Absurd! She shook herself free of the illusion.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden she saw it&mdash;a face. One
instant it was there among the spruce boughs.
The next it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A native?&rdquo; A prickly sensation raced up
her spine. It was night. She was alone, was
awake. Should she waken the others?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my watch,&rdquo; she told herself resolutely.
&ldquo;The face is gone. The reindeer are safe.
So-o&mdash;&rdquo; with a sigh she settled back in her
place.</p>
<p>When she awoke next morning she was
tempted to believe that her seeming to see that
face among the trees was the result of an overworked
imagination.</p>
<p>It was At-a-tak who soon changed her mind
about this. The native girl had stood a short
watch in the early morning. The face among
the trees had reappeared. The man had spoken
to her in his native tongue. The story she had
to tell was strange.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>This man she said was indeed a native of
Russia. He and his people had visited America
in a big skin boat. When they started on
the homeward journey, ice drove them back.
In America, they had no food. They must
hunt. Finding this herd, and knowing little
of American laws, they had driven it into the
hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; At-a-tak concluded, &ldquo;no more
drive reindeer, those Russian natives. I say,
&lsquo;Go away quick. White man will catch you,
put in jail, maybe shoot you.&rsquo; He say, &lsquo;Go
away quick.&rsquo; That one go away far. So,&rdquo; she
sighed, &ldquo;not bother reindeer more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Jodie laughed, &ldquo;we have one fine
reindeer herd on our hands. What shall we
do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them along; eat them one by one if
we must,&rdquo; was Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;But
now the cry is &lsquo;On to the mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On to the gold mine!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On to the mine! On! On to the mine!&rdquo;
came echoing back.</p>
<p>Not so fast. There was the herd of reindeer,
they must be driven on before. In spite of the
fact that this herd in an emergency would
save them from starvation, Florence felt inclined
to bewail the fact that this extra responsibility
had been thrust upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; she said to her grandfather as
they ate a hurriedly prepared breakfast of
sourdough pancakes, &ldquo;friends are fine, but
sometimes they are a lot of trouble. If John
Bowman hadn&rsquo;t been our friend, we might
have left those deer to shift for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; the old man spoke slowly, &ldquo;no, girl,
that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong. It does give us an
added responsibility, our friendship with John.
But reindeer are property, valuable property.
Many a man in this cold white world would
have starved had it not been for the reindeer.
So we&rsquo;ll have to look after &rsquo;em the best we
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; the girl thought with increased
admiration, &ldquo;surely is a fine old man!
If everyone was like him, what a world this
would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get there all the same!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom. &ldquo;You watch and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Phantom, old boy!&rdquo; Florence
shouted to the collie dog a few moments later.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get this Arctic caravan on the
move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog let out a joyous yelp and they were
on their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>It was growing dusk on that short day of
the Northland when, on crossing a low ridge,
they sighted a large oval spot that seemed jet
black against the surrounding white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A frozen lake,&rdquo; said Jodie.</p>
<p>For one full moment they stood there in
silence. The scene that lay before them was
beautiful beyond compare. The sun setting
behind white and purple mountains, the frozen
oval of water that in summer must seem a
mirror, the graceful reindeer wandering down
over the sloping field of white&mdash;all this beauty
would remain with Florence as long as she
lived. Yet the words of her grandfather would
linger longer. What he said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, girl, that&rsquo;s the lake. In fact, it&rsquo;s <i>the</i>
lake! And yonder&mdash;&rdquo; his voice broke with
emotion, &ldquo;yonder is the cabin Joe and I put
up so long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, as the girl looked closely, she
did see a small cabin, half buried in snow,
nestling among the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabin!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The cabin!
And now, where&rsquo;s the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time enough for that, girl.&rdquo; With eager
stride the old man started down the hill.
&ldquo;Time enough. The cabin comes first.&rdquo; At
that they all went racing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; the old man murmured a
half hour later, &ldquo;fifteen years have gone. And
yet here is our cabin, just as we left it. Even
the flour in that big can is good. No one has
been here since we left. Surely this is a
strange, mysterious, empty land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the gold mine?&rdquo; The words slipped
unbidden from Florence&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>At that her grandfather did a curious thing.
With one long bony finger that trembled
slightly, he pointed straight down at the center
of the floor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hid it. Hid it good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wh&mdash;where is it?&rdquo; the girl stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two middle planks we hewed out of a
spruce log,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Lift &rsquo;em up
and you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence and Jodie did lift the planks. They
did see. Beneath the cabin floor was a dark
cavity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very deep,&rdquo; the old man laughed happily.
&ldquo;Not far down to the bed rock. Flash
your light down there, son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Jodie threw the gleam of his electric torch
to the bottom of the cavity. Then an exclamation
escaped his lips. Casting back the
gleam of his torch, some tiny objects appeared
to turn the place into an inverted sky,
all full of stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; the old man murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gold,
son. Gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Florence had crept into her sleeping
bag that night, she found her mind filled with
many questions. Would they truly find gold,
much gold, down there in that dark hole?
For her grandfather&rsquo;s sake, she hoped so.
What of the reindeer? They were feeding and
sleeping now in that narrow valley. Would
they be able to drive these all the way to
Nome? Would those Russian natives truly
remain away, or would hunger drive them
back?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be trouble if they come back,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;Trouble. Troub&mdash;&rdquo; At that she
fell fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />TO BE OR NOT TO BE</h2>
<p>In the meantime life did not lack for excitement
back in the Matamuska valley.
Strange tales had come to Mary both by mail
and by air. Brought by air-mail, two letters
from Florence had reached her. They told of
the lost mine, of the dog race that was to be
run and of the all too exciting life the big
girl was living in the far North.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Santa Claus,&rdquo; Mary whispered when
she had read those letters twice. &ldquo;Speed Samson
said I should be little Miss Santa Claus.&rdquo;
She was thinking of those delayed Christmas
presents to the Eskimo children still lying
there in the postoffice in Anchorage. As she
closed her eyes she tried to picture the miles
and miles of timber, tundra, and endless snow
she must fly over to reach that strange land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speed Samson will take Mr. Il-ay-ok up
there,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I could go too and
take all those presents. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Yes, it did seem probable that when the
hunting season was over, Speed would, taking
a chance of being paid in fox skins, fly the little
Eskimo to his home. Truth is, he was growing
very fond of the little man. Having taken
him along on a hunting trip he discovered that
he was a capital cook and that he could prepare
meat in a manner that delighted his
guest-hunters. After that he took him often.</p>
<p>It was on one of these occasions that something
happened which made Mary&rsquo;s dreams
of becoming &ldquo;little Miss Santa Claus&rdquo; lighter
and brighter. Speed carried a short-wave radio
in his plane. It was on this evening, after
he had landed on the little lake at Rainbow
Farm, planning to stay all night, that the
thing happened. Mary, Mark, and Mr. Il-ay-ok
were in the cabin of the plane taking turns
at listening to the radio. Speed himself had
the head-set clamped over his head when suddenly
he exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some cute kids way up at Cape Prince
of Wales. School teacher&rsquo;s children or something.
Big brother&rsquo;s rigged up a short-wave
outfit. They think they&rsquo;re talking only to
some people on a small island seventy miles
away, but it&rsquo;s going out over the air. Something
about a Christmas tree made of willow
branches and a driftwood log. Seems there
was to have been quite a Christmas up there,
dolls, toys, candy, everything. The presents&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! I know!&rdquo; Mary broke in. &ldquo;The
presents didn&rsquo;t come. Too late for the boat.
They&rsquo;re in Anchorage now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a fact?&rdquo; Speed stared at her in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say-ee!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;Guess
they got on to my listening in on the air.
They&rsquo;re talking in some new lingo. Guess it&rsquo;s
Eskimo. Here, Mr. Il-ay-ok, give me your
ears.&rdquo; He clamped the head-set over the Eskimo&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah-ne-ca!&rdquo; the little man smiled
broadly. &ldquo;Yes. Talking Eskimo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo; Mary exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell now. Bye-and-bye.&rdquo; The Eskimo
waved her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; Mark scolded. &ldquo;It may be
important, a shipwreck, or&mdash;or something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>It was important, very important to at least
three young people quite far away. It was not
a shipwreck. An Eskimo girl was talking. Eskimo
people are born story tellers, and Kud-lucy
was telling a story to No-wad-luk, her
little friend at Shishmaref Island. The story
was long, but in her excitement she forgot all
else.</p>
<p>As Mr. Il-ay-ok listened to the tiny Eskimo&rsquo;s
story, Mary waited in breathless silence.
What will this story mean to me, she was
asking herself. Perhaps much. Perhaps nothing
at all.</p>
<p>Of a sudden Mr. Il-ay-ok dragged the head-set
from his ears. &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he smiled broadly.
&ldquo;All over now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us!&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s eyes shone. &ldquo;What did
they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long story. Must tell all,&rdquo; Mr. Il-ay-ok
spoke slowly.</p>
<p>He did tell all and a most interesting narrative
it proved to be. The little Eskimo girl&rsquo;s
story as he told it was this:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>There was to have been a Christmas tree at
the Cape. What was a Christmas tree? Oh,
something quite wonderful! So bright it was
that it shone like the sun. And on this bright
tree there grew all manner of strange things.
Little people? Yes, little people, no longer
than a man&rsquo;s foot, but all dressed in bright
clothes. Could they talk? To be sure. Yes,
and cry and close their eyes, and go for a
walk. Someone apparently had done her best
to give Kud-lucy a real notion of what a
Christmas tree was like. Had she succeeded?
You be the judge.</p>
<p>Yes, and there were to have been more
things, Kud-lucy hurried on. Small seals that
were not truly seals, and walrus and polar
bears. Yes, and many things no Eskimo had
ever seen before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now&mdash;&rdquo; little Kud-lucy&rsquo;s voice had faltered,
&ldquo;now there is to be no Christmas tree,
not any at all!&rdquo; Why? Because the big boat
had come too soon. All the wonderful things
apparently were left behind.</p>
<p>At this instant apparently little Kud-lucy
suddenly realized that she was talking in some
strange, mysterious manner to her friend far
away. The discovery frightened her and she
had gone off the air.</p>
<p>As the story ended, Mary jumped to her
feet exclaiming:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just think! To be Miss Santa Claus to a
hundred Eskimo children! But then&mdash;&rdquo; She
sat down quite suddenly to stare out into the
dark, cold night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long, long way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way is long any more, with an airplane,&rdquo;
he replied quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps. Who knows?&rdquo; Mary looked
at Mark. He said never a word. There was no
need. She could read his thoughts. He was
thinking, &ldquo;I love those Eskimo children, but
I love Mary more. I want her always to be
safe. And yet&mdash;I wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night beside the huge, barrel stove
in the Hughes&rsquo; cabin, Mr. Il-ay-ok talked long
of his people who lived on the rim of a frozen
sea. He spoke of the children, of their play
and their simple toys, of their cheerful natures
and happy smiles. With every word Mary&rsquo;s
interest grew. Her cheeks burned as she
dreamed on of that suggested flight into the
North.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas in Eskimo-land, dog-teams,
reindeer and everything,&rdquo; she whispered to
herself. &ldquo;Then perhaps Florence will be ready
to return and we shall fly home together.&rdquo;
How she missed Florence! Then and there
something like a resolve was formed in her
mind. Would she go? There would be solemn
family conferences, but in the end, would
she go? To this question, for the moment,
there came no answer.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Il-ay-ok was talking of other
things, he was telling why that man Loome
hated him. Somehow government officials had
been persuaded that the Eskimo should drive
their reindeer into the hills where feed was
more plentiful. This they would never do;
first they would sell their deer for very little.
Loome and his companions were planning to
profit by their misfortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; the little man&rsquo;s eyes shone, &ldquo;now,
I have the papers. Here,&rdquo; he patted his pocket.
&ldquo;Reindeer may stay as they are. The so wonderful
government has said that. My people,
they will be happy. But first I must show them
the paper. First day of next year it will be
too late. So-o, I must go. I must fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you shall fly,&rdquo; said Speed Samson.
&ldquo;Here. Shake on it.&rdquo; They shook hands in
silence. Mary&rsquo;s heart burned with hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Santa Claus in Eskimo land,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Next day Madam Chicaski, who had of late
been acting rather strangely, did the oddest
thing of all. When in the summer Bill had
returned from his fruitless search for gold, he
had left his pick and shovel in the Hughes
woodshed. They were still there. On this
morning Mary saw the large Russian woman
take the pick from the shed and march resolutely
toward the giant stump that stood in
the back yard. It was an innocent appearing
thing, that stump. All weather-beaten and
festooned with rustling morning-glory vines,
it seemed a thing destined to stand there for
years. And yet, as Mary watched, she felt
sure that this woman meant to attack its roots,
if possible to tear it from the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo; she asked herself. At that
moment her mind was filled with mingled
emotion, surprise, consternation and something
of alarm. This last she could not even
have explained to herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>There was, it seemed, no immediate cause
for anxiety. The big woman did not swing
the pick, at least, not that day. Instead as she
came near to the stump, using the pick for a
cane, she stood there leaning on it looking for
all the world like a picture called &ldquo;The Man
with the Hoe.&rdquo; On her face at that moment
was a look Mary had seen there before, it was
the gaze of one who worships at a shrine.</p>
<p class="tb">In the far away valley, work on the lost
mine progressed famously. Since the greater
part of the digging had been done long ago
by Tom Kennedy and his partner, there remained
little to be done save to pick away at
the gold-laden gravel, to hoist it through the
floor, then to wash it out in water brought up
from the lake. Even with so much of the work
done, it was a slow process. Days passed.
Each day saw Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s moose-hide
sack a little heavier, but each day brought
their small supply of flour, sugar, bacon and
beans dwindling lower and lower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll kill a fat reindeer and pay Bowman
for it when we get back,&rdquo; said Tom Kennedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather, if we are to drive those reindeer
all the way back it will take days and
days,&rdquo; Florence was worried. &ldquo;There will be
nothing left to eat but reindeer meat. Can we
live on that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try. Eskimo do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not Eskimo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o. But something will turn up. We&rsquo;ll
manage.&rdquo; The old man was too absorbed in
his golden quest to think overmuch of things
to eat.</p>
<p>Then came the great day. &ldquo;The mother-lode.&rdquo;
Tom Kennedy spoke to Florence. She
was at his side in the mine. &ldquo;See!&rdquo; The light
of his torch was cast back by a yellow gleam.
&ldquo;See! Nuggets big as bird&rsquo;s eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and will this be the end?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end, yes,&rdquo; his tone was impressive.
&ldquo;But enough. Who could ask for more? Only
look there&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo; He broke short off to listen
intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An airplane!&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s voice was low and
tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found us,&rdquo; the old man muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; was his strange answer.
&ldquo;No good ever comes from spying.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />COASTING UP HILL</h2>
<p>At very nearly that same hour a blue and
gray airplane rose from the frozen sea
near Anchorage. Its passengers were only
two, a dark-eyed, animated girl, and a stolid
little Eskimo man. At the controls was Speed
Samson. You will not need a second guess as
to who the passengers were, nor the nature of
the cargo they carried. Little Miss Santa
Claus, who in real life was Mary Hughes, had
her pack securely stowed away in the baggage
compartment of the plane. She was on her
way.</p>
<p>Two hours later she found herself drawing
her mackinaw closely about her. It was cold
in the small cabin of their airplane, stinging
cold. How high were they in air? She did
not know. How far north were they? She did
not know. She was not thinking of that so
much, but of the whole strange adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>It had taken courage to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; at last.
The postmaster in Anchorage had listened to
their story with interest, but he hesitated to
give his consent to their airplane delivery of
the packages of Christmas presents to Cape
Prince of Wales. &ldquo;It is quite irregular,&rdquo; he
had said, &ldquo;and you might never get there. It&rsquo;s
a great white world you are going into. There
are few landing fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; Speed had agreed. &ldquo;However,
I&rsquo;ve never yet taken off for any destination
and failed to arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; Mary had put in, &ldquo;if we
don&rsquo;t take their presents, they won&rsquo;t arrive
until Fourth of July, when the boats come.
And what&rsquo;s the good of Christmas presents on
the Fourth of July?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What indeed?&rdquo; the gray-haired postmaster
had smiled. Finally he surrendered and gave
his consent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s brow wrinkled as her
eyes took in the gathering gray around them.
&ldquo;Now it is going to snow and we&mdash;&rdquo; She did
not finish.</p>
<p>Yes, they must land. But how? Where?
Suddenly, seeming close enough to be touched,
a mountain loomed before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>With a wild whirl that took her breath, the
airplane swung about to go speeding along the
side of that jagged ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s beautiful&mdash;and terrible!&rdquo; she whispered
as she sat up to stare out of the window.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, it was all of that. Here was a wall
towering and smooth like the side of a sky-scraper,
and there a black shaft of rock rising
like a church spire, and here a shining river
that, as their eyes became accustomed to it,
turned into a broad glacier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow is falling faster. Where can we
land? And if we can&rsquo;t land?&rdquo; Terror gripped
the girl&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Of a sudden the plane once again swooped
downward. She caught her breath. What had
happened? Was their supply of gas running
low? Were they to make a forced landing?
Or had Speed&rsquo;s keen eye discovered some hidden
valley offering a safe landing? She was
soon enough to know.</p>
<p>Directly beneath them there appeared a
broad stretch of white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A valley!&rdquo; The girl heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>The plane circled. She was glad they were
to land now, for in the last two hours they had
made good progress. She was hungry. Soon
they would be brewing hot cocoa on the little
gas stove, heating canned meat and searching
out big round crackers. They&mdash;</p>
<p>Once again her thoughts broke off. The
plane had bumped. There was something
strange about that bump, too solid or something.
Bump-bump-bump, each bump was
stranger than the last.</p>
<p>But now she sighed with relief, for the plane
was coming to a standstill. Slow&mdash;slow, slower,
stop.</p>
<p>She was preparing to open the door, when
with a little cry of dismay she fell back among
the blankets. A terrible thing was happening,
the plane was gliding backward!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; cried Mr. Il-ay-ok.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;re on a sloping ledge. We&rsquo;re gliding
down&mdash;down! We&mdash;&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s voice ended
in a gasp. Her heart stood still, then went
racing on. The plane was gliding faster, faster,
ever faster, and back of them, not thirty
seconds&rsquo; glide, was a deep, dark abyss! They
had landed half way up the sloping mountainside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear God&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her prayer was answered before it was said.
The motor thundered. Their backward gliding
slowed. Slow, slower, stop. Then the reverse,
the motor picked up speed, and they
glided forward faster, faster, faster. Then,
with a startling lurch the plane swung to the
right. Next instant they were once more floating
on God&rsquo;s good free air.</p>
<p>Then, perhaps because they had seen perils
enough, the sun quite suddenly broke from
behind the clouds, the snowfall ceased, and
they found themselves sailing high over a
long, winding valley.</p>
<p>Two hours later, having sailed on through
a clear sky for many miles, and feeling the
need for rest and food, they circled low over
the frozen surface of a broad stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the Eskimo. &ldquo;Now we eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; Mary exclaimed, pointing off to the
left, &ldquo;there are three columns of smoke rising
up from the edge of the forest. People living
around here. Wonder what they are? White
men, Eskimo, or Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Eskimo,&rdquo; said Mr. Il-ay-ok, &ldquo;Too far,
this place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>So they came down. Three times, like some
lone wild duck searching a water hole, the
plane circled low. The third time it dropped
a little lower. Bump-bump-bump, glide-glide-glide
on their broad skis, and&mdash;a perfect landing?
Almost. But what was this? The ship
tilted sharply to one side. Mary, whose hand
was on the door, was thrown out to fall flat
on the snow-encrusted ice. For ten long seconds
it seemed the airplane would roll on
over and crush her. But no, still tilted to a
rakish angle, it came at last to rest.</p>
<p>What had happened? They were not long
in finding the answer. Early in the winter the
river had frozen over, perhaps two feet thick.
This ice had cracked. Water had flowed
through and flooded the ice. Once again it
froze over, but not thick enough. One ski of
the plane had broken through to settle down
on the solid ice a foot below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are, and here we stay.&rdquo; Speed&rsquo;s
tone had a sad finality about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Speed, can&rsquo;t we pry it out?&rdquo; Mary
asked hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; the pilot shook his head. &ldquo;Ten
or twenty men might do it, but not you and I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it shall be ten or twenty men!&rdquo; Mary
exclaimed. &ldquo;Christmas bells must ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; the pilot stared
at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw smoke, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she turned to
the Eskimo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;Three columns smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whites or Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;And who
cares? We must find them. They must help
us.&rdquo; She was ready for the trail.</p>
<p>And indeed there was need for haste, the
airplane was freezing in. So, forgetting their
hunger and their need for rest, they hurried
away in the direction of the three columns of
smoke.</p>
<p>Soon they came upon a trail leading into
the forest. In silence they followed that trail.
How still it was there in the forest! As a
snow-bunting flew from twig to twig, Mary
caught the flutter of his tiny wings. A snowshoe
rabbit, leaping from the trail, brought an
unuttered cry to her lips. Then of a sudden
a deep voice shattered that silence. It said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Seeming to appear from nowhere, a six-foot
Indian stood before them. He was not
dressed in skins and feathers, but his dark
face, straight black hair, and large hawk-like
nose told the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; said Speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airplane come?&rdquo; the Indian said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we are in trouble. You must help
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eskimo-land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eskimo bad.&rdquo; The Indian&rsquo;s voice dropped,
his dark face formed itself into a scowl. &ldquo;Very
bad, Eskimo. Long time &rsquo;go kill Indians&mdash;much
Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a long time ago,&rdquo; Speed agreed quietly.
&ldquo;Then came good white men. They told
the Eskimo no kill. Now all the Eskimos are
good. Tomorrow night is Christmas Eve. We
are bringing them presents, these good Eskimos.
We are in trouble. You must help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Christmas?&rdquo; The Indian&rsquo;s face lighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have twenty pounds of candy for your
children,&rdquo; Mary encouraged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, candy?&rdquo; The Indian&rsquo;s face grew radiant.
&ldquo;Indian like candy, like much. I bring
help, bring everyone. Come quick!&rdquo; He trotted
away.</p>
<p>Scarcely had they returned to the plane than
the edge of the forest swarmed with Indians,
little Indians, big Indians, men, women, and
children, and all eager to help.</p>
<p>It was no time at all until that airplane ski
was back on the top surface of the ice. Then,
after presenting the gifts of candy and receiving
a friendly farewell, the little party began
taxiing down the river two miles to a spot
where there was a supply of gasoline, and
where they might pile into their cabin for a
few winks of sleep.</p>
<p>Supper over, they tucked their blankets
about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In four hours,&rdquo; said Speed, &ldquo;if the moon
is out, we shall sail away. Tomorrow evening
will be Christmas Eve, and we still have seven
hundred miles to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven&mdash;seven hundred!&rdquo; Mary exclaimed.
&ldquo;Can we make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the sun and moon smile on us,&rdquo; Speed
replied cheerfully.</p>
<p>Little wonder that Mary whispered a prayer
for clear skies before she fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Meanwhile three cute children, Margaret,
Nellie, and Tom, the only white children at
far-off Cape Prince of Wales, were doing their
best to make up for the loss of their presents.
The Christmas tree of willow branches and a
driftwood log had been set up. Behind closely
drawn blinds, they had done their best to decorate
it. Rustling willow leaves had been
brightened by many feet of colored popcorn
strings. Here and there a red, green or orange
box hung. Safely shielded from dry leaves,
twenty candles shone. Common white candles
they were, but who cared for that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s grand!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half bad,&rdquo; Tom agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just think what it might have been!&rdquo;
Nellie struggled to hold back a tear.</p>
<p>Outside in the frosty night, little Kud-lucy
and No-wad-luk, two little Eskimo children,
were peeking through a crack not quite covered
by a shade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good!&rdquo; Kud-lucy danced up and down.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Christmas tree after all! And it&rsquo;s
almost as bright as the sun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the little people who walk,
talk, and go to sleep?&rdquo; asked No-wad-luk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&mdash;&rdquo; said Kud-lucy with a superior
air, &ldquo;they are walking. They are coming a
long, long way. They will be here tomorrow
night. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would they? Would the moon look down
and smile?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>

<br />BLACK WATERS AND GRAY DOGS</h2>
<p>When the airplane came roaring in from
nowhere to circle for a landing close
to the lost mine, Jodie and At-a-tak were away
bringing in the reindeer herd lest it stray too
far. Before Florence and her grandfather
could make their way up from the mine, the
plane had landed on the ice of the lake and
had taxied to a spot quite hidden from view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can they be?&rdquo; Florence asked in sudden
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some smart fellows who&rsquo;ve heard about
our lost mine. Come to help us dig gold, jump
our claim, perhaps,&rdquo; was her grandfather&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;Little good it&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;em. Three hours
more and we&rsquo;ll have the place about cleaned
out. They&rsquo;ll be welcome to the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;there may be other
pockets. They&rsquo;re welcome to them, too. One
strike&rsquo;s enough for us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just think, girl,&rdquo; his voice grew mellow,
&ldquo;thirty-five years in the North and now, success
at last. Ah, girl, it&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, grandfather, it is,&rdquo; Florence was
scarcely listening. She was thinking, &ldquo;Suppose
those men are looking for that reindeer
herd? What if they think we stole the deer?&rdquo;
She was having a bad moment.</p>
<p>Just then four men appeared at the foot of
the ridge. &ldquo;One white man, three natives,&rdquo;
was Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s instant announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That white man,&rdquo; Florence was startled.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something familiar about him, the
way he walks. Grandfather!&rdquo; her voice rose.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my pilot, Dave Breen, the man who
brought me to Nome!&rdquo; She dashed madly
down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Well! Think of finding you here!&rdquo;
Dave Breen exclaimed at sight of her. &ldquo;And
you a reindeer rustler! Know what they do to
&rsquo;em? Shoot &rsquo;em at sunrise,&rdquo; he laughed a roaring
laugh. &ldquo;But tell me, how come you&rsquo;ve got
the herd of deer we&rsquo;ve been looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s mulligan, reindeer mulligan on the
stove,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;And coffee&rsquo;s steaming.
Come on up and I&rsquo;ll feed you and tell you
our story, or at least part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come clean,&rdquo; laughed Dave.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sworn in as a deputy and I&rsquo;ve been instructed
to arrest any persons in possession
of that herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over coffee and mulligan, with her grandfather&rsquo;s
permission, Florence told the whole
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So your work here&rsquo;ll be done in a few
hours?&rdquo; said Dave Breen. &ldquo;Know what day
tomorrow is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you forgot. Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo; Dave
exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the day before Christmas.
And do you know what?&rdquo; he paused for proper
emphasis. &ldquo;Know what? We&rsquo;re going to leave
these Eskimos in charge of the reindeer; they
can bring them in O. K. We&rsquo;ll leave them
At-a-tak to mend their boots and her gray
team to haul their supplies. They&rsquo;ll be more
than all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for you and Jodie and that grandfather
of yours, I&rsquo;m going to pack you up in
my plane and fly you back to Nome for the
grandest Christmas you have ever known.
And you can&rsquo;t say no!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who would want to say no?&rdquo; Florence was
fairly overcome with joy. But there&rsquo;s many a
slip between a happy girl and a glorious
Christmas of a particular sort, as you shall see.</p>
<p class="tb">Some hours later, in another corner of this
Arctic world, the day before Christmas
dawned bright and clear. A blue and gray
plane rose gracefully up from a frozen river
to go sailing away toward the north. And little
Miss Santa Claus was still on board. Mr.
Il-ay-ok was still her traveling companion and
Speed Samson was at the controls.</p>
<p>Three hours they flew due north. Then they
came down upon a white floor of shore-ice to
rest and drink cups of steaming tea.</p>
<p>As Mary stepped from the plane she felt
her nose pucker. It seemed too that someone
with sharp tweezers had pinched her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold! Boo!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the North,&rdquo; Speed laughed. &ldquo;Just
over yonder is the Arctic Circle. Should be
able to see it in an hour or two.&rdquo; He laughed
again, and Mary laughed with him. But that
they were at last quite far north they knew
all too well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Two hours later found them flying high over
a vast black expanse, Bering Sea. As the girl
looked down she shuddered. It seemed that
this sea must be bottomless, for not a touch
of light broke its deep, purple blackness.</p>
<p>Across this expanse, like fairy fleets, ice
floes drifted. Once she was sure she saw a
group of moving objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walrus!&rdquo; Mr. Il-ay-ok shouted. &ldquo;How you
like landing among them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would not land among them,&rdquo; was her
answer. &ldquo;Our plane can land on ice&mdash;not on
water. We won&rsquo;t land unless&mdash;&rdquo; her heart
skipped a beat.</p>
<p>A half hour later her heart stopped altogether
for a second, then went racing. Their
single motor was missing and they were still
over the dark sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there it is again!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>She studied the look on Speed&rsquo;s face, then
shuddered anew.</p>
<p>A glance before her showed a white line.
Was it a shore line? And could they make it?
She dared not think further.</p>
<p>She settled back a moment later with relief.
&ldquo;Motor&rsquo;s working better.&rdquo; But this relief was
not for long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Ten minutes passed. The white line grew
wider. At one end was a high spot, perhaps
a mountain. Then again that chilling sput-sput-sput
of a missing motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it!&rdquo; she shouted bravely.</p>
<p>And in the end they did. Just as the motor
stopped dead, due to a clogged fuel pipe, they
found themselves over a blanket of white.</p>
<p>Circle low now. No chance for climbing.
Take the landing that offers.</p>
<p>They took it with many a shuddering bump.
Mary was thrown down upon a pile of Christmas
toys. A talking doll cried, &ldquo;Ma-ma!&rdquo; and
a croaking frog went &ldquo;Herouk!&rdquo; Then all was
still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, gathering herself up,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were. But where were they?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky to be here at all,&rdquo; was Speed&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re here for some time!
Require three days to smooth down these snow
ridges for a take-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three&mdash;three days!&rdquo; Mary cried in dismay.
&ldquo;Why, then we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>At that moment there arose a prodigious
noise. Dogs, dozens of them, were making the
air hideous with their barking. A moment
more, and their plane was surrounded by great
gray roaring beasts&mdash;Siberian wolfhounds, the
fiercest, strangest, bravest dogs in all dog-land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could anything be more terrible!&rdquo; Mary
wailed. &ldquo;We must be nearly there, and now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave our plane, just now, that&rsquo;s
certain,&rdquo; said Speed. &ldquo;But wait! Luck may
still be with us. Those dogs belong to someone.
They came from somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came from the hole in that snow-bank,&rdquo;
said Il-ay-ok. &ldquo;House there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That &ldquo;hole in a snow-bank&rdquo; was indeed the
entrance to a small low cabin quite buried in
snow. Then from that hole came a huge man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfect giant of a man!&rdquo; Mary was all
aquiver with excitement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a fairy
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant let out a great roar. The pack of
wolfhounds stopped their barking, dropped
their tails and one by one disappeared into
the hole in the snow-bank. Then the giant
approached the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Who are you?&rdquo; said Speed, popping
his head out of the cabin door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bill Sparks, a gold miner,&rdquo; said the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Yes, of course!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
Il-ay-ok. &ldquo;Excuse, please. I do not know at
first where we are. Now I know. Yes. Yes.
Very good man, Mr. Bill Sparks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your business, stranger?&rdquo; Bill
Sparks looked at Speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; Speed explained. &ldquo;This little
man&mdash;&rdquo; he nodded at Mr. Il-ay-ok, &ldquo;claimed
he needed to get back to Cape Prince of Wales
to save the Eskimos&rsquo; reindeer. So&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ve heard about that,&rdquo; Bill Sparks
broke in. &ldquo;Hope he wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! We win!&rdquo; Mr. Il-ay-ok waved
a paper excitedly. &ldquo;Here is the paper. All my
people shall know. They shall be told, keep
reindeer O. K. Grand Christmas, mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one more thing,&rdquo; Speed managed
to break in. &ldquo;Lot of Christmas presents and
little Miss Santa Claus here. I brought them
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Bill Sparks stared. &ldquo;I been hearin&rsquo;
about them presents. Every Eskimo that
drives by has been askin&rsquo; me if I thought
they&rsquo;d come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they what?&rdquo; Mary hopped out of
the plane in her excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; Bill Sparks insisted. &ldquo;You see,
Miss, this here&rsquo;s Cape York. Cape Prince of
Wales is only fifteen miles away. With them
big dogs of mine, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no drive at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&mdash;&rdquo; Mary began hopping up and
down. &ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll take you all over, Miss, and
all them presents. Be glad to, Miss. Nothin&rsquo;
I won&rsquo;t do for the Eskimos. One of &rsquo;em
brought me in when I&rsquo;d went snow-blind once.
I&rsquo;d have died if it hadn&rsquo;t a&rsquo; been for him!
Wait&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting two fingers to his lips, he blew a
shrill blast and, to Mary&rsquo;s terror, out from
the dark hole piled the great gray pack of
hounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need fer fear,&rdquo; Bill Sparks laughed, as
she started to climb back into the plane, &ldquo;my
friends are their friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it happened that, just after the short
day had faded and the Eskimos had gone to
their little log and sod homes,&mdash;with sleighbells
muffled&mdash;the happy flyers with Bill Sparks in
the lead, his sled piled high with Christmas
joy, stole round Cape Prince of Wales and
right up to the schoolhouse door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>They managed to get there without being
seen by a single Eskimo child.</p>
<p>It was Margaret, child of the schoolmaster,
who opened the door in response to their
knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas!&rdquo; Mary cried as the light
came flooding out. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here, and so&rsquo;s
Christmas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first sound of her voice, Nellie and
Tom came racing from the big room where
they were still stringing colored popcorn. Then
such low exclamations of joy! Such a rush as
there was as they bundled all the packages
inside, then paused to hug their benefactors,
Mary, Speed, and even the startled Bill Sparks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; Nellie cried at last.
&ldquo;All those presents! How could they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Santa never fails,&rdquo; laughed Speed at last.
&ldquo;At least hardly ever, and surely he could not
fail in Eskimo-land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no time at all until Mary and the
three children were busy trimming a more
gorgeous tree than the children of Eskimo-land
had ever known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />THE SECRET OF THE GREAT STUMP</h2>
<p>It was two hours before the beginning of
Christmas festivities, when the tree trimming
came to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a walk,&rdquo; Speed suggested to
Mary. &ldquo;This is enchanted land. Think of it,
Christmas Eve in Eskimo-land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s walk,&rdquo; Mary agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo! Such a coldness!&rdquo; she exclaimed as
they stepped outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow fog&rsquo;s drifted in too,&rdquo; Speed surveyed
the landscape. &ldquo;Two hundred foot ceiling and
growing less. Good thing we&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had walked over the half mile of ice-covered
beach to the foot of the mountain
and had turned back when Speed, stopping
dead in his tracks, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary, listening with all her ears, at last
caught a faint drumming sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An airplane!&rdquo; she looked at Speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is! In such a place and such a time!
Mountain there. Sea over there! All I can
say is, I wish them a happy landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full quarter hour, all unmindful of
the cold, of the dinner that awaited, and of
the glowing Christmas tree, they stood there
listening to the drone of the motor that now
rose in volume and now faded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; was Speed&rsquo;s decision. &ldquo;Looking
for a landing.&rdquo; Once, when the echo of
the motor&rsquo;s roar was thrown back as from the
mountain, he gripped the girl&rsquo;s arm hard.
What was he waiting for? A crash? It did not
come. Instead, the motor sounded out a mad
burst of speed, then began again that slow
droning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Speed shuddered, &ldquo;they know
where the mountain is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; a moment later he gripped her
arm once more. &ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to try
for a landing. Who knows where? We&rsquo;d
better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he had any notion of flight, it was futile,
for at that instant, far down the line, not
twenty yards from the schoolhouse, a gray
mass emerged from the snow-fog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy! He&rsquo;ll make it!&rdquo; Speed exclaimed.</p>
<p>Calmly they awaited the coming of the
plane as it bumped, bumped again, then taxied
slowly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary! Look at that plane!&rdquo; Speed became
greatly excited. &ldquo;Did you ever see it before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary made no answer. Perhaps she was
too excited to hear. One thing was sure, her
heart gave a great leap when, as the plane
came to a standstill, a large girl dressed in a
fur parka jumped from the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What are you doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; Florence stood staring at her as
if she were a ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth,&rdquo; Dave Breen, the pilot,
who now climbed from his place, said, &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t quite know why we&rsquo;re here. We don&rsquo;t
know where we are, but we&rsquo;re mighty glad
we have arrived.&rdquo; At this they all laughed.</p>
<p>The story of Florence and her party was
soon told. After completing their work at
the mine, they had packed their belongings,
including three moose-hide sacks of gold, in
the plane and had sailed away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We got caught in a snow-fog,&rdquo; Dave Breen
concluded. &ldquo;We flew for hours looking for a
landing. At last, in desperation, we took a
chance and here we are. But tell me, where
are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cape Prince of Wales, the very heart of
Eskimo-land,&rdquo; was Mary&rsquo;s happy reply. &ldquo;And
this is Christmas Eve. What could be finer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Florence caught the sound
of many Eskimo voices. Then the chorus
ceased and she heard the familiar voice of
Mr. Il-ay-ok. He continued alone. He was
speaking slowly, earnestly. Florence saw a
sober look come over each face. In the end,
when Mr. Il-ay-ok had finished, they exclaimed
in a low chorus: &ldquo;Ke-ke! (go ahead)
All right. All right. We bring &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he saying?&rdquo; Florence asked the
teacher, who arrived at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Il-ay-ok is telling of his airplane ride and
how much it was going to cost,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;They are really quite business-like, these
Eskimos. Il-ay-ok told them, since their
reindeer had been saved, they must contribute
one silver fox, three cross foxes or four white
foxes each.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And will they?&rdquo; Florence was interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Didn&rsquo;t you hear them say, &lsquo;All
right&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But truly there is no need.&rdquo; Florence was
struck with a sudden thought. &ldquo;There is
money in the bank at Nome, enough I am sure.
It&rsquo;s the part earned by Il-ay-ok&rsquo;s team when I
won the dog race. Tell them about it, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was little need of telling them in Eskimo,
not a man of them but understood about
money, even when told in English. But, like
every other people, Eskimo love to be told in
their own language. So the teacher told them.</p>
<p>If Florence needed any reward for her honesty
and fair dealing, it came to her from the
change of looks and the sudden exclamations
of the natives as they heard the rare news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mat-na! Ah-ne-ca!&rdquo; they exulted. Then,
&ldquo;Na-goo-va-ruk Along-meet!&rdquo; (Good for the
white one) rose like a grandstand cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Florence laughed. &ldquo;I had
my share and a lot of fun besides. And Merry
Christmas to you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Il-a-can-a-muck! Il-a-can-a-muck!&rdquo; (Thank
you! Thank you!) they shouted in a chorus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>It goes without saying that the entire party
attended the Christmas tree festival and all
enjoyed it to the full. Surely nothing could
have been more delightful than the privilege
of watching the eyes of a hundred Eskimo
children as they saw the tree for the first
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; Mary heard little No-wad-luk exclaim
to her small friend. &ldquo;See! There are
all the little people who can walk and talk
and go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; was Kud-lucy&rsquo;s proud
reply. &ldquo;They <i>did</i> come. They <i>did</i> walk all the
way miles and miles. And they <i>did</i> get here
just in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence and Mary were scarcely expecting
presents. They got them all the same.
They were long, slim socks made of fur taken
from the legs of a spotted reindeer fawn and
they were filled with gold nuggets. On Florence&rsquo;s
was a tag saying &ldquo;From a long-lost
grandfather,&rdquo; and on Mary&rsquo;s &ldquo;To little Miss
Santa Claus.&rdquo; Never, I am sure, had there
been a merrier Christmas Eve than this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Christmas morning broke bright and clear.
After bidding their new-found friends good-bye
and listening to the Eskimos&rsquo; &ldquo;A-lin-a-muck&rdquo;
(Good-bye) and &ldquo;Il-a-can-a-muck&rdquo;
(We thank you) the happy party sailed away
for Nome, where they enjoyed a late evening
feast of roast venison, wild cranberry sauce,
plum pudding and all the trimmings.</p>
<p>Three days later Mary and Florence were
back in the rustic cabin on Rainbow Farm.
Florence had urged her grandfather to accompany
her to the valley. He had refused,
one airplane ride had been quite enough, and
then, when one has lived in the far north
thirty-five years&mdash;ah, well, perhaps next spring
he would come down on the boat and they
would buy a claim in her happy valley, who
could tell? So she had left him, happy in the
realization that his dream of a lifetime had at
last come true.</p>
<p>And now since they had used up their tickets
to adventure, a long winter in a peaceful valley
lay before them.</p>
<p>But there was still Madam Chicaski to wonder
about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>On a wintry morning, three days after her
last happy landing, chancing to look out of
the kitchen window, Florence, to her unbounded
surprise, saw the powerful Madam
Chicaski wielding Bill&rsquo;s pick in a most surprising
manner. What was more surprising
still, she was executing a vigorous attack upon
the great stump over which bright flowers had
cascaded all summer long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop! Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; These words
were on her lips. She did not say them. Something
appeared to hold her back.</p>
<p>A moment more and she was glad they had
not been spoken, for after one powerful swing
of the pick, a dark spot had appeared beneath
the stump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cavity!&rdquo; she whispered breathlessly. &ldquo;A
hollow place beneath the stump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, like a flash it came to her. This tree
had not grown there. The stump had been
hauled there, probably on a stone-boat, for
the purpose of concealing something. But
what did it conceal?</p>
<p>Fascinated, the girl continued to stare as
the woman picked untiringly at the base of the
great stump. When at last the Russian woman
seized a stout pole, and using it as a pry,
tipped the stump on its side to uncover a
broad, deep cavity, the girl&rsquo;s curiosity got the
better of her and she ran into the yard to exclaim:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Madam! Madam! What <i>are</i> you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; On the woman&rsquo;s face was a glorious
smile. &ldquo;See! All my beautiful things!
All safe after these long years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did see and her astonishment grew.
The great copper kettle was there and the
seven golden&mdash;well, perhaps they were only
gold plated&mdash;candlesticks, and many other
things as well. A curious old copper teakettle,
a set of beautiful blue dishes which, by instinct,
the girl knew were very old and valuable,
and many other things were there.</p>
<p>Slowly, carefully, they removed each piece.
Then, quite overcome with emotion, the aged
woman sat down upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said after a long silence, pointing
a thumb at the hole in the ground, &ldquo;was
our cellar. The ground is always frozen there.
It keeps everything cool, everything. Ivan,
my husband, hauled down the stump to make
a place for my flowers. When we left we said,
&lsquo;We will hide everything in the cellar,&rsquo; it was
a secret cellar, no one knew. &lsquo;Then we will
put on the stump. No one will guess.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And no one ever did.&rdquo; Florence laughed
gaily, happy for the other&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>The final chapter to this little mystery was,
if anything, stranger, more happy than all the
rest. Both Mary and her mother had always
loved fine and truly rare china. Massive copper
pots and pans had always fascinated them
as well.</p>
<p>That night, as supper time approached,
Madam Chicaski insisted that candles should
be put in the golden candlesticks and that they
should be set, all flickering and alight, three
upon the mantel and four upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as Ivan and I used to do,&rdquo; she added
with a happy sigh.</p>
<p>Supper was to be cooked in her copper pots
and pans and served upon the beautiful blue
dishes that made Florence tremble every time
she touched one of them, lest she drop it.</p>
<p>It was a memorable meal. A little Indian
girl had, that very afternoon, brought in a
great salmon and had received for it a sack
of potatoes. The baked salmon rested on a
blue platter. It was surrounded by golden-brown
potatoes, sweet butter and tall heaps
of biscuits fresh from the oven.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>When this repast was over, the Russian
woman sat for a long time staring at the
flickering candles and the marvelous blue
dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she murmured at last, &ldquo;they shall not
go. They have been here long. They shall remain
forever, all these beautiful things. You
all are good. You have been kind to an old
woman whom you did not know. I am not a
fairy godmother,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I am not
God. I am only an old woman, Madam Chicaski.
And this was my home. Yes, you shall
have all these. They belong here. Even dishes
and copper pots may be happy. They will be
happy with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary heard her every word. Yet she could
not believe in their great good fortune. All
these beautiful dishes, those rare pieces of
copper, the seven golden candlesticks to remain
in their humble cabin? Impossible.</p>
<p>Then came another wave of emotion that
brought her to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Madam!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You will
need them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I need them?&rdquo; Madam laughed again. &ldquo;Did
I not tell you? But no. I have not told. We
are rich, Ivan and I. Ivan&rsquo;s uncle died. He
left all to Ivan. That is why we went away
so fast. That is why we never came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; her tone changed, &ldquo;I shall go
back to Ivan. He is not strong, Ivan. He
could not come. But I&mdash;&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;It was
necessary that I come to see once more. Now
I have come. I have seen. And I am, oh, so
very happy!&rdquo; She heaved a great sigh of joy,
then moving to her place beside the fire, took
up, perhaps for the last time, her peaceful
dreams of those days that had passed, never
to return. Next day, after bidding them farewell,
she was to go trudging away toward the
railway station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Florence whispered to herself as
she crept beneath the covers in her loft-bed
that night, &ldquo;life can be strange and beautiful.
It can be peaceful as well. Here in this happy
valley one might find peace. But do I want
peace? Mystery, adventure, the, long, long
trail.&rdquo; At that she fell asleep.</p>
<p>Did she accept peace or did she again take
up the long, long trail? You will find the answer
to that in the book called <i>Third Warning</i>.</p>
